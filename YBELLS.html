<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">This is my sort of &quot;goto&quot; modern art to see the magical connection between &quot;<a href="http://m.lamc.la/ERANDSON.html">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</a>?&quot; and a sort of real life ... well, a story about the rise and fall of systems and interfaces to help us see how easy it is to turn down &quot;hate and pain&quot; and replace it with &quot;drive and happiness&quot; instead.&nbsp; It&#39;s a single episode of Dr. Who with a poingnant name and and a visualization of something &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QU1nvuxaMA">I&#39;ve seen in the pages of a book about a bruised sky and a ... well, they lead us</a>&quot; on ...</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">The same technology that could replace addiction with &quot;an end to schizophrenia and to depression and to ...&quot; that same thing could equally be used to create a mindless army of slaves that believe they&#39;re voting (would you believe, voting subconsciously? maybe a Universe built on the &quot;will to power me&quot; or on ... the &quot;power of the law of attractiveness&quot;) anyway, I&#39;ve talked a little about what I see as a near absolute eventuality ... a system that includes what I call &quot;limited omniscience&quot; which is ... plugging Alexa <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+31%3A31-34%2CEzekiel+36%3A24-28&amp;version=NKJV">into your heart</a>&nbsp; with a transparent actually subconscious psuedo-anonymous voter record that I sort of see mapped in the actual meaning of the words &quot;<em>social security number</em>&quot; if not the first act of the newly infused land of &quot;land, oil, and light are not scarce&quot; to turn into something a little closer to Zoltan Istvan&#39;s living wage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Anyway, I&#39;m actually considering writing some fiction because the imaginary imagery being pumped into my daydreams is getting to cute and interesting that I can&#39;t imagine losing phrases and company names like &quot;<em>Accured</em>&quot; (and I spent some time transforming it and reading &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BETHESDAY.html">anureddit&quot; ... a new ... sword--perhaps</a>)&nbsp;as a sort of example of what I might name&nbsp;a company designed to build &quot;truth tables&quot; for plugging into our pre-vote minds in a world where these kinds of things are created in competition, in a marketplace maybe using &quot;web of trust&quot; and of course a competing system of &quot;checking them&quot; that&#39;s a little more de<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/put-paid/">fined and useful than Snopes</a> and the <a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2018/06/25/california-considers-fake-news-advisory-group/">new California &quot;fact checking authority.&quot;</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">It&#39;s trivial to see, how if you were building a system like this with the intent of it actually working and caring about the ... you know, the &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MUASEEKHART.html#addsearch=government%20of%20the%20worker">office worker</a>&quot; .. you&#39;d automatically check the newldy adulterated subconscious vote against a ... well, against your soul&#39;s actual desire and through that process of reconconciliation probably come up with a whole host of disilluions, fixes, adjustments, and of course bugs--probably bugs to be fixed too.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I&#39;d much rather actually build something that works than write story after story about something I know has already been built, and already sent us a &quot;version 7.0 roadmap&quot; I&#39;d like to see it implemented here, in the place that it was designed for, by, and with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I envision a future sort of democracy built on &quot;many parties&quot; and a technological infastructure for defeating the Elephant and the Donkey and the &quot;two of everything God&#39;s Ark&quot; of ideas ... to actually build a technological governance system that aids the legislative process in coming up with solutions and ensuring that forward progress comes from the stagnatory soup of &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron">me-ta</a> <a href="http://iv.s.lamc.la">nada</a>&quot; that might be a timeline and &quot;all nations&quot; or maybe I&#39;m the only one talking about the beginning and the end of &quot;<em><a href="http://na.s.lamc.la">the name</a>.</em>&quot;</span></p>
