of eavesdropping infrastructure that you probably agree
is designed to help ease this message and this
fundamental change in "state of being" across our

noted numerous times that I think it's designed to help
you aid in the dissemination and understanding of what's
possible and "who we should do" (that's very important,

<font size="-1">That's how I feel tho, it really is--I see
very clearly that there are numerous people actually
helping me--though it's difficult to imagine how you too
do not see that the line here, the salt line in the
Manna from Heaven is actually talking about these things
as if they are ... exactly what they are ... an
intelligent message that is about something we cannot
see, written in conjunction with that invisible
force--and that speaking about "fiction" or "art" in
this now very provable vain that it is in fact, fact--is
more than a single word, it's more than artifact and
it's more than a single person.&nbsp; Still, I am
sitting all alone as far and wide as I can see in the
recorded "frank public discussion" about the fact that
we are living in virtual reality and cannot fathom how
you all don't see that's a great chain--some kind of
hidden slavery.<br>
<br>
You might see it as "Forbidden Knowledge" (that is in
itself proof of a dark force breaking logical vision
thorugh history--quite apparent today, <a
href="http://fromthemachineorg/TY.html">YW</a>) and
see I put space in between "for" and "bid" and "den" and
you are trying to take that space away from the very
strange invisibleness that seems to want to find it for
"no reason they care to speak of, either."&nbsp; I need
some vocal troops.&nbsp; Aside from BB&amp;T, <strong>IN</strong>G,
and Wells Farokh (which is Freddie Mercury's actual
name).&nbsp; I don't see any reason anyone here would
prefer to "rough it in the outback" over a much happier
and healthier life in Heaven--though it seems that this
grand conspiracy believes that it will somehow "force my
hand" by simply pretending that you didn't know that the
proliferation of this knowledge would protect us ... and
our children ... and their chidlren ... from pain and
death.<br>

what it is that I see and interact with--or what you
really are.&nbsp; I can't be certain if you "have a
brain" and by that I mean that the only way I think the
kind of behavior I see every single day would be
anything near "OK" is if you did not.&nbsp; It appears
to me from the mythology of the "n" and the stories I've
seen that perhaps it's something like your own soul
returning to your body after a long stay in Heaven that
I am wrestling with--and it's very obvious to me that
even if it is exactly you + some years away; you are
being made a slave here in this place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The
direct contact I have reeks of "body snatchers from
Heaven" rather than "subtle influence" and there's
simply no way to clearly convey to you how obvious that
is--or that your lack of verbal response furthers that
fear.&nbsp; I could be looking at "local layers of
separated reality" or I could be looking at a full
fledged invasion from the future, either way--it should
be clear from this message that spans millenium that
it's not here in response to me--and it flies in the
face of everything you as a group purport to be on "your
face."</font></blockquote>

behavior that I see is inexcusable, even if you think
you're (only, right?) hiding some kind of hidden contact
from Heaven or from aliens that you think is designed to
"protect your way of life from being disrupted" ... even
if you're only hiding something of that magnitude from
yourselves and the world ... you appear to be <strong>sacrificing</strong>
<strong>every</strong> single <strong>thing</strong>
about our way of life that I loved ... our privacy and
our freedom and our love of ...&nbsp;<em>new things
...&nbsp;</em>all for what amounts to a war against
the son of God to keep him from realizing his dream of
kissing more than two girls at the same time.</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2">Out of jest, it's pretty clear
that you think you're fighting for something of great
worth, and it seems to me the lesson to be learned is
that there is no such thing that worth giving up
everything you love and everything that you are -- even
if it's for "ompnitopence" which I've tried to explain
just makes you "<em>him</em>" anyway.</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="-1">The silence indicates to me that
you are very interested in "what you can do" (like
defeat Jesus Christ Superstar in his plot to rekindle a
love for democracy, self-rule, and individuality) rather
than my preferred plan of coming up with some common
"what shouldn't be allowed" infrastructure.&nbsp; In the
meantime, you appear to be unable to do anything useful
here, including speak, acknowledge or discuss the truth,
or uh... "Minority Report."&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that
should be obviously indicative of ... something
awry.&nbsp; I plan on discussing details about what I
imagine would be a useful "system infrastructure" for
the walls the halls and the doors that connect these
"Holorooms" in the book--and I'll probably send it to
you too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></blockquote>

obvious that the only thing that will change is that

Ending world hunger and healing the sick are not
"optional" they are the reason we have religion, and the

have laughed at me when I said that the Second Coming

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend"
title="Legend">legend</a>&nbsp;tells of a test
where&nbsp;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muramasa"
title="Muramasa">Muramasa</a>&nbsp;challenged his
master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword.
They both worked tirelessly and eventually, when both
swords were finished, they decided to test the results.
The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small
creek with the cutting edge facing the current. Muramasa's
sword, the&nbsp;<i>Juuchi Yosamu</i>&nbsp;(十千夜寒, "10,000
Cold Nights")&nbsp;cut everything that passed its way;
fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which
blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil's work,
Masamune lowered his sword, the&nbsp;<i>Yawarakai-Te</i>&nbsp;
(柔らかい手, "Tender Hands"), into the current and waited
patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam
right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by
the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his
master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his
sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword,
dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was
heckling him for his sword's inability to cut anything. A
monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over
and bowed low to the two sword masters. He then began to
explain what he had seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The first of the swords was by all accounts a fine
sword, however it is a blood thirsty, evil blade, as it
does not discriminate as to who or what it will cut. It
may just as well be cutting down butterflies as severing
heads. The second was by far the finer of the two, as it
does not needlessly cut that which is innocent and
undeserving."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In another account of the story, both blades cut the
leaves that went down on the river's current equally well,
but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa
whereas they would slip on past Masamune's after being
sliced. Or alternatively both leaves were cut, but those
cut by Masamune's blade would reform as it traveled down
the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by
Muramasa's blade while the leaves were repelled by
Masamune's, and another again has leaves being sliced by
Muramasa's blade and healed by Masamune's.</p>

swords that don't hurt kids.</p>
