Sirius and it's pretty interesting.&nbsp; What this light has shown me is that you are consciously and willingly unified in this Silence... this sick and disgusting thing that today appears very clearly to be designed to perpetuate Hell.&nbsp; Whether or not it's your intention, your actions--not calling a newspaper or posting these messages on Facebook (by the way, there's a "sharing" toolbar on the side of my free book--all you have to do is click a button... anyway, whether or not it's what you're trying to do ... the Silence is keeping the world enslaved in this twisted and coiled mass of people who are ignoring a message they know comes from the Matrix and from the hand of Jesus Christ telling them the point of all the music is to let freedom ring, and the point of all the dysptopian fiction is to help ensure that we don't have a dystopian future--but that's what you're trying to build anyway.&nbsp;</div>
