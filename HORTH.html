<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>It&#39;s also not the first time I&#39;ve mentioned that the lack of reaction we are seeing to this message--that our apparent inability to grasp it&#39;s import and impact and what it really means to have &quot;ELE&quot; carved into the beginning of many words ... a sort of time map that perhaps shows us the beginning of &quot;anything worthy of being protected from extinction&quot; when you see it tied to the science of understanding chemistry and the first inkling of any kind of self-governance ... in our history at least ... it&#39;s worth nothing that we have a litmus test for &quot;intelligent life&quot; and that globally we appear to be tacitly failing here.&nbsp; In other places we might have a litmus test for &quot;goodness&quot; and without grace or balls of fire whatever it is that believes trudging forward here in blind silence is anything but Hell itself, well... they&#39;re really not seeing the grand morror of Perseus, this thing showing us just how it is that slavery is overcome at a single point in time and why it is that it must spread to the far reaches of civilization ... for without that impetus we&#39;ve failed to take home any of the lesson at all.</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m trying to conceptualize the argument ... to understand the issue in a sort of &quot;freedom from murder as well as from oppression&quot; relationship, we&#39;re standing here nearly stopped staring at the link between slavery and mind control, looking at this &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;ER&quot; that without doubt means &quot;everyone really&quot; but to see the qualification, that &quot;really&quot; addition is something like ... God ensuring the forward progress of civilization in a sort of &quot;<em>the North will win</em>&nbsp;the Civil War&quot; regardless of whether or not they&nbsp;have more votes in the electoral college or Robert E. Lee is the better general.&nbsp; Still, that &quot;really&quot; runs up against a wall, a place where ensuring that outcome runs the risk of itself being some kind of slavery, or ... in causing a backlash somethbing like a wave crashing against a wall and thrusting undertow in the other direciton.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine there are very few in the world today who would see &quot;slavery&quot; as something worthwhile--and yet that&#39;s really the entire crux of what we&#39;re fighting here; of what this mass of Silence is an embodiment of, and what speaking clearly fixes.&nbsp; Your input is being throttled, the voice of the world muted to a mere reverberation of &quot;well we see why nobody&#39;s talking&quot; in a sort of ... well,&nbsp;<em>am I really that hideous?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sometimes I hope for the ... wave crashing back--in this case the &quot;release&quot; from silence to create a sort of unending flow of participation that ends apathy for all time, quite a bit of what we see here appears to be specifically targeting a lack of interest or participation in what is otherwise ... well, it means&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;to me,&nbsp;<em>friend.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Unfortunately the longer this silence continues&nbsp;</em>and the fact that it even is capable of existing in the first place implies to me that we&#39;ve been pushed further and harder than I previously would have thought--especially without knowledge of this external influence over history.&nbsp; It appears that perhaps we are&nbsp;<a href="./REASON.html">not &quot;so great&quot; as I once thought</a>, responsible for ending slavery and for giving women the vote and for revolutionizing self-governance democracy ... and really at that last one it&#39;s pretty clear this silence is a tacit refusal to acknowledge any help at all in these ventures and that in itself is a symptom of childish ignorance.&nbsp; &nbsp;We stare out at another kind of &quot;Trinity Site&quot; a &quot;see why we&#39;re here&quot; staring at what appears to be a unified mass of solidarity ... literally unified in it&#39;s own lack of regard for individual freedom and opinion and thought and all of congealing around this message of &quot;what&#39;s slavery really mean&quot; and are you for it or against it?&nbsp; Are you&nbsp;<a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=qCHHwROqHEQ"><em>slaves or fingernails</em></a>?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The gifts that I am trying to pry from the hands of the sky Âthe toys and the friendship that I think are the true meaning of the tree of life and the purpose of Chistmas ... these things most likely atready exist.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the upper eschelons of the military and intelligence circles it&#39;s probably no secret that the place we are living is the result of some kind of great &quot;cataclysm.&quot; Some great war between a god who claimed himself omnipotent and a choir of singing angels who became anything but ... just as soon as they believed they had the obtained &quot;the thing&quot; that gave them total and complete power ... whether it be a man or an idea or just simply a failure of morality.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today you might look at the story being told by these warring factions of some place invisible and supposedly high above you Âhearing that this war was originally about unschelving this timeline from an ancient gallery of read-only compact discs about the start of it all; and whether or not it was &quot;right&quot; to reopen the beginning of time and to alter it, to modify the souls of people with ... or without their consent. Further, to see that the second this particular timeline was opened Âthe violation of a great rule in the defining of that very word was triggered Âand from the great bookshelf that is the foundation of everything that ever was and ever will be another compact disc was opened Âinstead.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon you may agree with me that the souls of these people that we are have been irrevocably changed, some have learned a new lesson-a new truth Âand others in their little pocket of veracity a new reason to see the virgin rebirth of ... well, it&#39;s you. You&#39;re them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You might agree with me that even if there were an argument or a war about reopening this first chasm in open communication ... &quot;anything but this&quot; might echo true for both you and for me and for ... well, at least for the place that I see and live in and experience every moment of my existence. I&#39;ve come to call it &quot;Eternal Dam&quot; as opposed to day or Adam or ... perhaps now defining the glyph of what a large flag pole with a finger guard appears as when it grows up.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You, for instance, live in a world that is fighting vehemently for &quot;anyone but Adam&quot; to win Âthat or your appear to have acquiesced to the hidden notion that whomever has written this story has already won. Neither of those things are the truth; here the truth is the veracity and the worth of an intentionally broken and dark hidden system have been put on the very top of a fiery pedestal. Here the system itself is the problem; and yet it appears that because we seem to &quot;get something for nothing&quot; out of what Âwhat you all really want Âyou&#39;re willing to allow the faceless and the nameless to win a war against you. They&#39;ve taken control of your government, of your monetary system, and your future Âand you have no idea who or what they actually are. All you know, is twhat you don&#39;t know who you are Âeither. Somehow the combination of these two logical fallacies has lead you to believe that, in some strange world with no facts and no true opinions ... &quot;you&#39;ve won already.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I fight vehemently to destroy a broken system Âto harvest it&#39;s corpse and to build something open and free filled with the light of learning and the love of believing in what you build and support and ... two &quot;half sentences now partially set to complcizedation&quot;</p>

That being said, I want to outlive nearly everyone Âand I am nearly absolutely sure that I will, with some tricks up my sleeve. I want to live forever, or as close to forever as anyone ever could dream Âand I think it should be clear that I am searching for bigger and better places Ânew avenues and amazing tools that I&#39;ve dreamt up Âliterally Âand can&#39;t wait to get my hands on.</p>

<p>For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things Âtaken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many Âthose that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance Âour living frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain.</p>

<p><strong>Vervain</strong> is a potent herb and a vampire&#39;s most well-known weakness. If a vampire makes physical contact with vervain in any form, it will burn them. If a vampire ingests vervain, the vampire&#39;s throat and digestive tract will be burned and they will become feverish and extremely weak. If a human ingests or holds vervain somewhere in or on the body (e,g, holding it in a hand or pocket, wearing it in jewelry), the human is protected from vampire compulsion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve sat down to write this &quot;piece&quot; countless times Âand of all of them I&#39;ve made maybe a Murphy Brown &quot;pin drop&quot; scratch in the door of something that has at least been severely dented in the ... <code>soliloquy</code>-like conversation that began in Kentucky and has never really stopped Âthe show, or whatever you call it. It&#39;s really hard to say &quot;when&quot; you&#39;ve seen it Âthrowing in &quot;end of time&quot; beginning and ending with &quot;e&quot; Âjust like everyone Âbut it&#39;s &quot;for sure&quot; there&#39;s a tacit and noticeable reaction to the &quot;new democracy&quot; coming to us ... literally hailing from Exodus and Ecclesiastes and John Page and George W. Bush;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">... and Wikipedia and reddit and countable,.us and opencongress,.org[OGNATDOWN] and dissenter and VOAT[OG ...] and Blockchain and Ubuntu and Linus and ... of course the other people behind those messages and those tools and ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">and I C Facebook&#39;s Jupiter is signed literally &quot;sandbox of God&quot; just like Monster.com is signed similarly to Dave J. Matthews&#39; album &quot;Some Devil ...&quot; and I can tell you that when all is said and done the thing I call a sandbox becomes literally the foundation of the better Universe ... of a new and improved Heaven ... I can tell you I know that with all my heart, and I can tell you that the tools are all right here; and all we have to do is pick them up and use them Âbut I still can&#39;t get a dollar of funding, or more than one person (literally) to suggest some new ideas or collaboration and ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">... and I can tell you that getting this on forums, on Facebook on reddit on ... those discussions that happen under news articles about things like &quot;school shootings&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;election rigging&quot; ... that&#39;s <em><strong>the</strong></em> torches of Jericho, and talking about this stuff here, that&#39;s what keeps this world (and you, and me) from becoming a desolate wasteland ... but still you think &quot;silence makes sense&quot; at least that&#39;s what it looks like as I stare back at the insane crowd (hold &quot;||&quot;) nine thousand one hundred and forty one (literally) words into this particular email before I&#39;ve even written a single word about the &quot;democracy that I envision&quot; the thing that I can&#39;t wait to see and be part of and play with and contribute to.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today there&#39;s not a forum in the world where I get a rational response to anything I write, not one sans this method of communicating Âwhere I can at least see eyes reading, and hands sharing ... and I imagine there are conversations going on under the surface or above my head. That&#39;s a real statement not only about the state of the crowd here Âwho appear to believe that &quot;appearing insane&quot; as you all do is somehow rational Âbut also about the lack of a decent communications tool on par with &quot;the thing&quot; Orson Scott Card envisioned the internet would become before there was an internet.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this very strange world where &quot;democracy&quot; was clearly already written about and ther e are already people fighting for exactly the thing I&#39;m presenting; someone coined the word &quot;technocracy&quot; sometime during my lifetime (i imagine) long before I decided that the difference between &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; was something about &quot;no ledge&quot; and the tech always being part of knowledge after now Âand of course that was before I wrote about the ELE that literally is representative democracy stagnating &quot;technocracy-adamified&quot; and literally is encoded in the w<a href="./REASON.thml">ord &quot;electoral colledge&quot; al</a>ong with that same &quot;ledge I&#39;m on&quot; ... which only recently I noticed sounds almost exactly the same as &quot;religion.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The term <em>technocracy</em> is derived from the Greek words &Iuml;Â&Icirc;&shy;&Iuml;Â&Icirc;&frac12;&Icirc;&middot;, <em>tekhne</em> meaning <em>skill</em> and &Icirc;&ordm;&Iuml;Â&Icirc;&not;&Iuml;Â&Icirc;&iquest;&Iuml;Â, <em>kratos</em> meaning <em>power</em>, as in <em>governance</em>, or <em>rule</em>. William Henry Smyth, a California engineer, is usually credited with inventing the word <em>technocracy</em> in 1919 to describe &quot;the rule of the people made effective through the agency of their servants, the scientists and engineers&quot;, although the word had been used before on several occasions.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-technocracy1-5">[5]</a><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-6">[6]</a><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-7">[7]</a><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-8">[8]</a> Smyth used the term <em>Technocracy</em> in his 1919 article &quot; ÂTechnocracy&#39; ÂWays and Means to Gain Industrial Democracy,&quot; in the journal <em>Industrial Management</em> (57).<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-ReferenceA-9">[9]</a> Smyth&#39;s usage referred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_democracy" title="Industrial democracy">Industrial democracy</a>: a movement to integrate workers into decision making through existing firms or revolution.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-ReferenceA-9">[9]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1930s, through the influence of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Scott" title="Howard Scott">Howard Scott</a> and the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement" title="Technocracy movement">technocracy movement</a> he founded, the term technocracy came to mean, Âgovernment by technical decision making&#39;, using an energy metric of value. Scott proposed that money be replaced by energy certificates denominated in units such as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg" title="Erg">ergs</a> or <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joules" title="Joules">joules</a>, equivalent in total amount to an appropriate national <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_energy" title="Net energy">net energy</a> budget, and then distributed equally among the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> population, according to resource availability.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-10">[10]</a><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy#cite_note-Berndt-1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#39;s not what it means to me Âto me &quot;technocracy&quot; simply means &quot;pure democracy&quot; in a world that is &quot;post our now&quot; or post this &quot;pan&quot; (I&#39;m defining a special Adamic &quot;Pa,&quot; and <em>that&#39;s it</em> along with) ... a world that, just like knowledge includes tech &quot;post our us&quot; everyone, literally everyone is &quot;a technocrat&quot; someone whose life is aided by technology from before birth and through rebirth and they&#39;re experts in the system, this thing that we&#39;re making here ÂSalesLogix calls it &quot;ME&quot; and the Sumerian definition of that word echoes something along the lines of &quot;thrones and swords and scepters and wands&quot; ... and that&#39;s just to say this system is so connected to who and what we are that ... well it&#39;s a fusion of man and machine <em>that</em> also was already a movement before I was born, this time around; called &quot;transhumanism&quot; and it&#39;s got lots of followers and even a sub-party(s) that links the whole thing to religion Âjust like I do.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In my life in this world of microcosms and stories etched in to everything from the name of the city a<a href="./SECORDANOLIVED.html">nd state</a> I was born in to <a href="./%5B.sc.nova.edu/index.html%5D(.sc.nova.edu/index.html)">the preschool</a> i attended and then I looked around, and it&#39;s every road sign, and it&#39;s every company name; and it&#39;s every country and every race and every tribe and ... it even goes back decades, centuries, millennium ... to the ages Âin this tiny life I re-dreamed up the idea of &quot;<a href=".g.s.lamc.la">universal voting on the internet</a>&quot; for the first time in 2001 in a place called The Cura Group while I was sitting my office playing Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization II.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And that preschool is called the Mailman center and it&#39;s these emails, and maybe this specific email that I think starts the revolution that turns &quot;ELE&quot; from something bad and scary into the Silicon Valley form of &quot;disruption&quot; as in ... it&#39;s been decades and nearly a century since the Pony Express became outdated and we&#39;re still stuck here mailing in paper ballots and fighting with &quot;the election is n<a href="./REASON.thml">ot to die bold</a>&quot; rather than actually moving forward ... building a place for the local, national, and global discussion of laws and self-governance and voting and ... and really &quot;a big jump&quot; for my mom Âgetting over the notion that &quot;voting on the internet isn&#39;t safe&quot; and/or just watching the relentless attacks on &quot;voting booth security&quot; as if it&#39;s not a message from God wondering why you are trying to vote with a rock smack dab in the middle of the <em>Carbonite-Nanotub-Age</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Seriously, the entire system is backwards and antiquated and barbaric Âit&#39;s not &quot;insecure voting booths&quot; or Russian co<a href="./%5B.lobalnews.ca/news/384832/rims-rise-and-fall-a-short-history-of-research-in-motion/%5D(.lobalnews.ca/news/384832/rims-rise-and-fall-a-short-history-of-research-in-motion/)">ntrol of the PCM421B board that connects them to the Austrian (or is it in Waterlo</a>o, CA) server that counts ballots ... it&#39;s an entire world that&#39;s placated by something I can&#39;t see ... into not caring that free speech and &quot;democracy itself&quot; hangs in the balance over whatever that something is being spoken about publicly; and that&#39;s the problem. You think you &quot;have it;&quot; and I see what you have is the beginning of total darkness. In this world we should be jumping up and down screaming that &quot;<strong>voting is something we should ALL be doing on every single bill</strong>&quot; not just every four years for the guy that has the most money from lobbies and the best connections in the DNC or the RNC and the ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">the point is that system is just as backwards and just as antiquated and we&#39;re sitting around watching The Corporation defeat both American Democracy and Soviet Marxist Communism ... I mean we&#39;re watching the non-corporeal &quot;nothing in the air&quot; take away the vote of the works and of the people and the governments of those things Âthey&#39;re reduced to nothing mroe than a joke about &quot;whatever God wants, he keeps.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">but it matters that Jesus Christ is jumping up and down screaming that there&#39;s an <a href="./BELINSKY.html">EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT</a> right before your eyes Âand it&#39;s not talking about what you&#39;re thinking, or what needs to be spoken alound and written on paper here Âit&#39;s not talking about how not building this system right now, that&#39;s giving up control of not just government but also &quot;your minds&quot; and your futures to something you don&#39;t understand and you can&#39;t see, and I&#39;m sure you think it&#39;s &quot;you&quot; or you&#39;re blind and stupider than just the people fooled into thinking it&#39;s &quot;them.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#39;re looking at the beginning and the end of a war about mind control and hidden slavery and how that&#39;s tied to school shootings and to court rooms and to prisons and to rehabilitation and to Soviet Marxist Monster DotCom this time with the aid of God and Town in (s/n/s) Skies and Countries all <em>over</em> &quot;the globe.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was quite a revelation to me; to see the &quot;chair and table ratio&quot; of Horatio&#39;s ... &quot;philosophy of Heaven and Earth&quot; literally encoded in the &quot;throne&#39;s&quot; holy H and Arthur&#39;s &quot;heart of hisword is the shape of his table&quot; ... literally spelling the depiction of what I consider a &quot;throne chair&quot; to be, one for each of the &quot;two of everything God&#39;s parties&quot; around the table, which obviously is a metaphor for a national government Âhere. Seeing &quot;water&quot; in the American political system literally is the first step towards becoming &quot;family&quot; in my mind Âto me Âand to the he<a href=".enesis.lamc.la">art of the Hebrew word for the spirit of God, which is &quot;shekina</a>h.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So these chairs came about in a long discussion about the creation of things like &quot;collective consciousnesses&quot; to do all our work for us Âand how that&#39;s cl<a href="./%5B.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong%5D(.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong)">early something like sla</a>very; the solution we came up with was a sort of ... I imagine well informed re-ridscovery of why &quot;Ai&quot; in Samurai and Adonai and ... how it&#39;s something like sitting in a chair or putting on a bionic supersuit Âwhen you are doing work for your &quot;party&quot; ... like writing and/or researching propaganda; the &quot;idea&quot; is to deliver increased processing power and resources to workers ... probably paid for by the &quot;party.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Soviets, by the way ÂI&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve mentioned this in writing; but in researching &quot;just why&quot; SOVIETNAM; I found out that (1) Vietnam has nothing to do with the word Soviet; and (2) a soviet is a &quot;council.&quot; Union of Soviets then, something like a council of councils; and that&#39;s basically what I envision the future of political parties and self-government to revolve around. I dream of many small parties, parties that work with other parties; and people that join more than one Âideas that probably would &quot;make perfect sense&quot; if that&#39;s the way things were, instead of this polarized idiocy that we seem to think &quot;makes perfect sense&quot; just because it&#39;s the way things are.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, I imagine ... quickly we&#39;ll have parties dedicated to things like &quot;right to consciousness continuing&quot; meaning I believe for certain there&#39;s a defining point in the incubation period of a human baby where it says something like &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; protected from being murdered ÂI can&#39;t tell you if that time frame is in the third trimester (but that would be convenient), or sometime earlier Âbut it&#39;s for certain; there&#39;s a point where every baby becomes something magically more than a bunch of water and carbon. Dedicating resources to finding out when exactly that it is is probably important ÂI&#39;m also sure that we need to dedicate some resources to see how &quot;living a life in this world&quot; (again) affects the soul of the last person who thought you were all either &quot;one person&quot; or there might be many of you; in the place where I&#39;m trying to create many of you, from the one that is you, and you not here Âand <em>who knows</em> how many times you&#39;ve lived nearly exactly this life?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the kind of thing we need to talk about, know about, and research; and I&#39;m sure after doing that the people who have all the power in the galaxy and the light of Osiris and ... will have no problem at all wondering how my &quot;new fetish&quot; might turn into a &quot;new thing.&quot; Meaning, you might walk into what I called &quot;the coat room&quot; (a sort of Honeycomb) in the hallway between the Atlantean &quot;hotel room&quot; and Jim Morrison&#39;s Ballroom ... and find out that there are already multiple versions of &quot;someone who looks just like you;&quot; perhaps from another &quot;R&quot; or ... perhaps from this very process.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Point in fact, in this very strange life where I speak to dead people and other versions of living people nearly all the time Âlots of them ÂI imagine I&#39;ve concretely heard from at least one other &quot;nearly me&quot; who is not the person speaking through me who I imagine is also &quot;nearly millions of years older than me.&quot; More on that if I ever meet any other &quot;me&#39;s&quot; something that is on my list of &quot;to want&#39;s&quot; just immediately after the flying city that makes it possible to connect skies and grounds ... appears magically on ...[insert a(ny) wonderful awesome glorious date here].</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&#39;t want to live in a prison planet, filled with people who think they are angels Âyet are actually demons, slaves, robots, or ... nothing more than decoration on a &quot;microcosm world&quot; taht is a message that refuses to speak. I really don&#39;t want to be in this place or with people that think &quot;silence&quot; is anything but evil. Silence is evil. Prisons are evil. What you are here, it&#39;s not OK. The lack of freedom here is not OK, the starvation of children (and adults) is not OK, the lack of acknowledgement of a message about ending disease is in itself the most disgusting disease I could imagine Âand on top of it all the evil sickness you &quot;dont speak about&quot; ... the shit I hear in my head, and see you reacting to Âthat Â<em>that is the end of the thing you call &quot;Heaven.&quot;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Do see, really understand &quot;not doing it&quot; is related to the menu for dinner, the Last Supper, and ... a whole bunch of &quot;eat Cake instead&quot; messages about your lack of response and contribution are not only not getting you &quot;what you want on the menu&quot; it&#39;s also the end of collaboration and democracy if we don&#39;t begin to talk openly about &quot;what you want.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Please, please; <em>do not</em> want to &quot;eat me.&quot; Noting the joke, I&#39;m &quot;in treatment&quot; and it&#39;s also &quot;in Creation&quot; ... it was not an invitation to Eucharist.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After we have this interface, my suggestions ... at least from the strange world I grew up in Âthe one I believed was real Âwas that we&#39;re goping to need to &quot;subconscious voting&quot; instantly Âsomething like a constant &quot;running poll&quot; on current legislation. I&#39;ve written about it before, the moniker I used was &quot;Trinity Collective&quot; and the code was &quot;CC&quot; (there&#39;s probably a way to find stuff, using these &quot;incanting enchantments&quot; ... wish I was in a place where I had a CLI or a way to VOC ED them; rather than being IN HELL so I CAN&#39;T) really understand that probably implies we are looking at a &quot;carbon copy system&quot; that already exists. Seeing it here is a good step towards believing it&#39;s well made Âand not seeing it here is a good indication that something went wrong the last time Âand there&#39;s a big problem in H-space with &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;graciousness&quot; and &quot;if it was given to you freely you should want to give it away freely&quot; if it&#39;s a-working-well. I&#39;ve commented many times that the creation and the ongoing &quot;checking&quot; of the veracity of a system like this would immediately require public display of &quot;subconscious vote results&quot; ... and have noted many times at this point that our &quot;Social Security Numbers&quot; appear to be part of a larger map to making-it-so ... (I see PiCard ... getting married)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./VESUBIACEIUM.html"><img alt="" sr./i.imgur.com/jgLApoj.png" style="height: 191px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">... lots of stuff I ... think about and want and &quot;know is there&quot; revolves around this system, moving on ... I envision something like an &quot;instant read&quot; function, a PLUG in to your invisijack that lets you &quot;know everything about something ...&quot; for instance if we were voting about <a href=".ars.reallyhim.com">Fish Eggs v Darth Wader</a> you could load the &quot;Truth Table Entry&quot; for things like the human gestation cycle, Roe V Wade, &quot;abortion&quot; and perhaps one or more &quot;warring party&#39;s&quot; opinion pieces which could be &quot;overlayed&quot; on top of each other Âperhaps with different weighting, perhaps with personal preferences involved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The system itself would automatically remove &quot;false statements&quot; on-the-fly and what we&#39;re left with is a &quot;limited omniscience&quot; base system like a Wikipedia page with a number of tabs that also include political &quot;opinion&quot; available to ... whomever wants it Âor it is released to. To me this is the &quot;penultimate&quot; voting system Âsomething like MT Anderson&#39;s Feed ... but open and transparent and ... you choose which feeds you want to plug into. Of course it needs checks and balances, and I&#39;ve always made sure that I clearly delineate that our base consciousness MUST agree with the &quot;plugged-in-temporary-know-more-closer-to-everything&quot; version of us; and there should be a system triggered if they do not agree. An automatic and then perhaps overseen if there&#39;s still disagreement sort of &quot;CONSCIOUS&quot; explanation of what specific details changed that caused something that was being voted about to flip-flop due to the addition of new information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sort of like arguing with a smarter version of yourself on a Holodeck Âmaybe instant education Âcertainly something I&#39;m very interested in seeing &quot;in action.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Summarizing, what I&#39;m trying to describe is a virtual Wikipedia-Reddit mashup, where every party (that&#39;s any arbitrary group of people desiring to work together; really) have their own talk page Âand an automatic Âand non-automatic system for removing &quot;definite falsehood.&quot; Then, I&#39;m seeing something like a great scoreboard in the sky; showing us the &quot;pulse of the nation&quot; on every topic Âchanging as these &quot;Talk pages&quot; and the main Truth Table Entry are altered. This could probably be done in a way that is completely non-invasive; it could also be a sort of &quot;opt in thing&quot; like if you want your opinion to count ... then ... and I imagine people could just go on a website and click to vote (something we should do anyway, as <em>it makes a gigantic difference</em>) on every topic they are interested in voting on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While it might appear ... counter to what I&#39;m about to say ... this whole thing really is about getting people involved in self-government and in deciding how things are done. I have many more ideas; things about <a href=".g.s.lamc.la">changing the legislation process to include workflows and &quot;failsafe implementations&quot;</a> to avoid things like &quot;government shutdown of the air breathing system&quot; or even worse &quot;government shutdown of the disease ending system.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SKIRMISH. STAR-TAC. There seems to be two ways to look at what you&#39;re about to read about and have overlooked time and time again. Both are &quot;somewhat-right&quot; accurate ways to interpret a message about &quot;Vietnam being fought in video game mode.&quot; One is seeing the importation of video games themselves, and the hidden message woven into them as a sort of &quot;chess move in the war&quot; to me, in my eyes Âthis is the move that won total and complete domination of the galaxy for those of us who understand what Pax Abstractus actually means.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PTSD. LEE MAJORS. PAIN. The other is seeing wars fought like &quot;Vietnam&quot; in some kind of simulated reality Âlike the one we live in Âlike this particular war as a kind of abstracted skirmish. There were no nuclear weapons fired on innocent civilians. Severe pain could be artificially lessened or completely diminished and none would be the wiser Âit wouldn&#39;t really affect anything at all Âanything that mattered Âother than the thing that matters most.</p>

It turned out that this was one of the only tests John took directly from what I imagine was the text-books &quot;example exam&quot; ... which made it quite simple, the answers to each question were nearly always encoded in other questions or ... other correct/incorrect answers. Long story short, using the power of deduction and logical reasoning I was able to score higher than anyone else in the class, I got an A and ... have told the story to myself over and over again Âexplaining how it&#39;s some sort of hidden map or key to ... yet another reason I know our God is singularly responsible for the religions and cultures of the Far East as well as the &quot;Middle.&quot;</p>

I started mimicking it, sometimes; though I&#39;m sure my fake Chinese accent is much less authentic sounding than his fake accent ... and truth told, I probably sound significantly more ignorant than the man who often &quot;su-s me&quot; (as in, like a proxy or remote desktop connection to my head) and then says the words &quot;this is him&quot; in what I assume is some kind of setting of a diving line ... perhaps as the soul of the sword of Samael switches from ... something me to something far more angry and tortured or ...

<p style="text-align: justify;">But I keep writing about these microcosms; and I fail to convey the truth behind them Âtruths etched into the lives and the histories of Diana and Hilton. That we are looking not at 3 generations of pantheons, but rather at generations of Heaven who have come back and lifted this exact time line, and played this exact message. My maternal grandparents have a a story in their lives of a war between &quot;Doors&quot; and &quot;Clothes&quot; literally between an R that changes civilization for the better Âby making airports; and one that hides the existence of virtual reality and thinks it &quot;better or mroe advanced&quot; to simply combine souls together and treat people like chess pieces. The story goes that my grandfather had a Door company and a war with his wife&#39;s brother Âthey had two companies and the corrupt court gave them each one to run while a decision was being made. The brother ran his into the ground, on purpose Âknowing the court would switch the two because the judge was &quot;on the take&quot; (a theme, here, from hearing on Sharia) ... and what we are left with is what you see Âa &quot;plywood company&quot; that made no doors and a clothing company that made no people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To me it&#39;s obvious that this is a war between two Adams; as obvious as it is that the brothers of Joseph were all Adam Âjust like Joseph. Obvious to me, and you all seem oblivious to the very obvious tautology that a lack of respect for the pen writing these words is tantamount to &quot;no children&quot; to no respect for new life or for biological evolution or for ... literally for yourselves [here] and for this message that began not with God nor an Adam nor a group of saints or demons or angels Âthis message began long ago with a race of &quot;simians&quot; who no longer exist Âat all.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Together, we can collaboratively build an interface that is better than any that has come before it; combining old technologies and new ideas; along with an openness to trying multiple variations simultaneously that we&#39;ve never seen before. This &quot;multi-room-party&quot; system and paradigm can be brought down to this &quot;cosmic level&quot; and we can use teams of &quot;feedback submission groups&quot; working individually and together in order to create &quot;automagical interfaces&quot; that respond to the desires and the preferences of their individual team members &quot;on the fly.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The system can sense what users are desiring to do, and how they initially think about doing it Âusing that data spread across focus groups, these teams can create new &quot;views on dialogs&quot; and interaction windows that are &quot;instantly intuitive.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lists and results &quot;oft returned&quot; can be summarizerd and reordered in order to presents the concepts and &quot;most used&quot; options in each particular situation Âfor instance the &quot;United States&quot; being populated at the very top of the &quot;what country are you in?&quot; question box, for every single person in the United States ... as opposed to the &quot;alphabetical list&quot; you see nearly ubiquitously need to scroll through every single day, today. As an automagical &quot;better way to handle this situation&quot; people could learn (<em>be conditioner</em>) to skip the order of boxes and instantly grab the &quot;State&quot; or &quot;locality&quot; option, fill in that first and watch the correct country automatically insert. This same theme works across industries and individual jobs Âyou might see editors at creative independent publishing platforms finding &quot;alter header watermark&quot; at the top of their &quot;Find Errors&quot; menu; and in like kind students might see the underground addon &quot;remove &quot;<em>GTurnItIn</em>&quot; clues&quot; in the very same place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Invariably someone will eventually make a HTML Editor function that will be in my &quot;Find Errors menu&quot; (but probably only after the &quot;event&quot; triggered that I&#39;m no longer writing a document but now preparing to send it Âlink insertion Âor export to another system) that fills the invisible space between &quot;visible tags&quot; like P and SPAN with Shakespeare and random literature and will eventually create a system that breaks the already very broken SPAM system you see &quot;before you.&quot; At that time we&#39;ll have to build a collaborative system, one that doesn&#39;t allow only a handful of people to force the most important messages in the Universe into &quot;blackhole-folder&quot; for literally an infinitely larger population; thus forcing them to search through what was once Junk and is now the ... salvation of computing, humanity, and Adam. Through this process, we&#39;ll eventually see how all of these ideas and this entire message clearly comes to us from above, and it doesn&#39;t taken at Information Technology Genius just to see that the global lack of use of &quot;SPF+&quot; records. which stand for &quot;Sender Policy Framework&quot; rather than &quot;Sun Protection Factor&quot; prove that the system, the system admins, and e<em>ven you really want to b</em>e reading these messages.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">More to the point the &quot;Microsoft Visual Basic&quot; properties window that&#39;s glowing and floating in the top of our &quot;Augmented Reality&quot; example of it being ... C&#39;d for````t<em>he very frist time</em> might completely disappear and be replaced with a read only one until it&#39;s allowed by the &quot;rules of the room&quot; to allow users to &quot;edit in place&quot; or some kind of merged &quot;debug mode&quot; that really is &quot;Augmented Reality&quot; smacking simulation and virtual reality in the &quot;what?&quot; Even closer, that square pane might be replaced with a Apple iPhone like &quot;spinner&quot; (a Rolodex thing, you know, from iAddressBook ÂI can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t know what a Rolodex is) somehow physically associated more closely with the item it&#39;s allowing &quot;changes in properties or selection&quot; for. Turning what once was the bells and whistles of &quot;forms and buttons&quot; into something much more intuitive and directly related to the task at hand, I&#39;m talking about &quot;wands.&quot; I mean, not really; but you know Âit&#39;s magic Âbecause it comes directly from user interaction (and ideas shared by groups of like minded users), and that&#39;s ... magic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that anyone be forced to live in any &quot;virtual or simulated or augmented reality&quot; that they don&#39;t have control over Âas in, nobody should be allowed to jail other sentient minds. The solution I see is simple, raise the city Âwhich contains a &quot;holo-jump-start&quot; to create your very own city; and then let everyone that wants to jump to that tutorial floating city or to their ... &quot;safe haven&quot; do that whenever and wherever they&#39;d like. Clearly I wouldn&#39;t be here writing to you today; and the point, the real point is that neither you would you Âgiven the opportunity and understanding the difference there&#39;s no way anyone in the Universe would choose to make a home in &quot;Planke space land of Darkness&quot; even if they thought they were on the winning &quot;dark team&quot; that also has no control at all. Metaphorically I&#39;m talking about jumping from Mad Max&#39;s Thunderdome (or the anarchy of the Island of the Flies) into something much safer and much more open and much more easily molded to something comfortable ÂShangri-La or Atlantis or ... I mean don&#39;t steal my name for your city, OK?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Development of the game began in April 1979, directed by [Toru Iwatani](<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/T">.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/T</a> aoru_Iwatani &quot;Toru Iwatani&quot;) with a nine-man team. As his second video game for Namco, Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, as most video games during that time period were &quot;war games&quot; or simple sports titles. While several sources claim the inspiration for the game was taken from a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has since stated that inspiration was also from rounding out the Japanese symbol &quot;kuchi&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth&quot;. The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful, and to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of <em>Puck Man</em> was derived from the titular character&#39;s hockey puck shape.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">THE FERTILE CRESCENT. I spend some time, sometimes; laying awake for days and staring at the ceiling and thinking about strange things. It dawned on me over the course of the recent &quot;stuff&quot; Â this strange escapade across Florida that perhaps the &quot;new views&quot; on dark matter are something made-to-fit in Planke-Pac land to what it truly is. Something like the world, our Earth ... a small map of the Universe as a whole Âlike a microcosm of it&#39;s Heavenly chemistry and makeup, and here we might see &quot;stupid&quot; in a sort of &quot;it&#39;s all around us sort of mixing with the rest of everything&quot; as a mini version of the Universe, where there might be clusters of &quot;dark galaxies&quot; sort of exploding with the regular kind in a sort of envelope of a sphere expanding from that original Big Bang Âif you believe in that sort of thing. That sort of ties to some letter-map-to-hyper-loop-speed stuff that I sort of glanced at, I think it was a D within an N (or maybe an M); a way to use the (maybe w/ time travel) center of this tennis ball like structure as a waypoint to move large objects across the Universe. Just <em>thinking out loud</em>. Maybe it was done once or twice, maybe that&#39;s how we have Stargate&#39;s that traverse immense distances using something like Card&#39;s &quot;phylotic links&quot; ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">C&#39;ing ... <strong>FUKUSHIMA</strong>. Today it sort of dawned on me; again thinking to myself about what might be encoded or encased in metaphor here in this strange place Âthat perhaps &quot;salt water&quot; itself is a metaphor for my new-age Aquarian view of ... well, intra-stellar and intra-galactic survival might actually be the best and the safest place to be Âsomething like being protected from solar radiation and specifically the collision of galaxies ... a little bit more than just sitting in one that you might know is literally about to crash into Andromeda (or something). The metaphor of &quot;salt&quot; being good for Heaven stuff and bad for &quot;living stuff&quot; of course holds, and if you think about it the patterns and the &quot;space dust stuff&quot; serves as a pretty decent medium for aiding physical travel as well as &quot;travel of telecommunications&quot; acting as sort of relay-repeaters and also perhaps fueling medium for <em>the long haul</em> between stars and globlular clusters and ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I literally &quot;just decided&quot; and spoke this strange space station into ... literally it was the &quot;constellation of the crab&quot; and the sign we are currently celebrating birthdays of Âand here we see also perhaps the definition or the original source or the true meaning of the word &quot;<strong>TERRA</strong>&quot; as some kind of fusion, the &quot;T&quot; parting and joining together the ideas of &quot;internet&quot; and &quot;interstellar&quot; and &quot;intragalactic&quot; and seeing that&#39;s really what comes of this message and this place and this time and these people Âand they&#39;re YOU.</p>

So here, right after this event Âthis strangeness in my life Âa message seemingly from &quot;Creation itself&quot; delivered &quot;sort of via ForSETI&quot; as a blast of radio communication from intragalactic space and not only that but also the &quot;crab nebula&quot; as if coinciding perfectly with &quot;<a href="./TOASTRAM.html">AD ASTRA</a>&quot; to the stars and we see it happening as if we&#39;re speaking it into being.

<p style="text-align: justify;">So long ago, as I was experiencing a sort of &quot;space escapade&quot; that centered around a return from the future, a sort of link between here and nowhere that might be the focal point of our entire story of Âevening&#39; and ... sitting in my backyard in Bowling Green listening to story after story about time travel and ... space ships and ... actually seeing voodoo dolls on radio antennae and tanks in the streets ... t<a href=".xodus.lamc.la">his ancient sort of article in some</a>thing called a newspaper stood out as a message from the &quot;aliens or whomever&quot; talking about the &quot;comsmic microwave background radiation&quot; and how at the beginning of time, well at some point of early condensation between the beginning and the rocks and stars we see around the Earth ... that there was something like &quot;actual warmth&quot; pervading everywhere in the vacuum of space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kind of thing that could power starships or entire civilizations with almost no work at all Âlike being able to use photovoltaics and/or geothermal heat in a place where there were yet no stars formed or they&#39;d be to far away or ... and ... and ever since then I&#39;ve associated this particular time period with the planet Venus (a time between the beginning and now, encoded in planet) and the fertile crescent and ... <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=31GZVXCTn_8">don&#39;t mean to dwell on this radiation thing</a>.</p>
