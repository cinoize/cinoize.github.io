  In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve actually now seen with own eyes what is very clearly an ability to &ldquo;cut and paste&rdquo; memories together&ndash;to pause time, to &hellip; skip forward, and to do so in a way that is pretty trapsarent and scary. Obviously nobody wants to be frozen in time or have memories that jump from decade to decade with no &hellip; continuity of &ldquo;real.&rdquo; I mean, I think nobody wants that. I basically watched a rewind, several second, complete with memories of performing the same action, say &ldquo;typing these words&rdquo; literally three separate times in my memory with the words on appearing one single time. It&rsquo;s an observation, it came after some words from the sky &hellip; &ldquo;can we show him?&rdquo; with some excitement.

   Around Christmas, associated with the concepts of OEM and refurbished and &quot;factory warranty&quot; expiring I kind of thought about the idea that maybe the &quot;hardware&quot; that I&#39;m clearly describing the rico-creation of ... maybe it&#39;s at some end-of-life stage where it needs to be updated or replaced, and even in the few brief sentences I connected to Y2K and B0K (2000, and 2011) I sort of wasted our time explaining what I see as a possible gap &quot;in space&quot; between (C the Light) Ark and Kenterprise ... a complete overhaul or a Unix-like &#39;MV&quot; rather than a Assember &quot;MOV&quot; that (an ASM MOV is basically just a &quot;copy&quot; operation, with no &quot;RM&quot; of the source) really is the reason Asimov has his name ... and the point there is that if there&#39;s some .. unforseeable and unfathomable constraint preventing K&#39;s message (which is religion, and words, words like &quot;infirmity&quot; and &quot;

   &quot; and &quot;confirmation&quot;) from being actually executed ... if there&#39;s something keeping us from being able to &quot;heal the sick en masse&quot; that the clear right thing to do is move everyone and destroyed the broken machine--nobody wants to be stuck in a broken machine, right?

   Anyway, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt that &quot;morality&quot; and the knowledge that this message presents, the meaning and impact of the two letters &quot;Si&quot; and the change wrought by being on a &quot;silicon chip&quot; rather than on &quot;terra firma&quot; (more confirmation?) ... that there&#39;s just no way that it&#39;s socially acceptable to continue simulating pain and disease in a place where &quot;the rest state&quot; rests my case for me, we certainly would be better off in a place that didn&#39;t do the extra work required to ... you know, spread diseases and simulated the impact of bullets in a place where that&#39;s still extra work, even if the rules of natural law were ... &quot;automatic.&quot;

   &nbsp;In that same line of thiniing, &quot;the rest case&quot; gives us plenty of impetus to understand why it is that it&#39;s just obviously morally wrong to &quot;print a planet full of people&quot; in reality ... in the place that ... under this specific circumstance really is the worst of all Hells; to a place where there truly is no way to escape from pain and infirmity other than death--and surrounded by a message explaining that they are the &quot;heart of Heaven&quot; at least, as soon as they receive and respond to those specifi words.&nbsp; It&#39;s really rooted in every bit of every word, seeing &quot;heart&quot; as Earth re-arrainged and the blood of Christ pumping in it, post the explanation of the First Plague, that ... it&#39;s family in the place that literally saves the future from pain and disease and death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

   There&#39;s plenty of research now, philosophy and statistics coming from people like Nick Bostrom; work that basically implies that there&#39;s almost zero chance at all that we are not living in a &quot;simulation within a simulation&quot; and thinking about it, when you start to think about it you&#39;ll probably agree that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Though, here, we have a chance to gaze at what the &quot;embedding&quot; of OLE (as a key, it&#39;s one of my keys) and what a &quot;line feed down&quot; actually means--that&#39;s not a place where anyone will just magically wake up and be inside a &quot;second bubble&quot; deeper in this strange concept of simulations within simulations that ... Rick and Morty ... for instance ... lit up for the kids.&nbsp; What it really means is forcing this world to pretend they are in reality, and in that pretense ... themselves creating an entire infrastructure for mind uploading and for immortality--servers probably owned by governments and major international corporations that might &quot;sell&quot; to you (and then to your children, who I imagine would have to support your continued playing in ... heaven within hell within heaven) the prospect of not having to have a body to decay and grow old, but rather ... give you exactly what I&#39;m trying to explain is the fruit of responding to this message about already being in &quot;hell wthin heaven&quot; and turning it into something better.

   So I can&#39;t personally think of any reason anyone ... anywhere ... would want a layer of Zombies between Heaven and another Heaven; I certainly see it as a very scary prospect, that anyone here would want or desire to be &quot;in control&quot; of an entire world of fantasy growing beneath them--all the while knowing in their hearts that they themselves have no actual control over their own faculties or facilities and that .. well, something very immoral is happening now and would continue to happen until we decide that it&#39;s not OK to &quot;starve babies&quot; or to torture&nbsp;

  Just a brief comment, as I&rsquo;ve just begun disgussing the &ldquo;bi-message&rdquo; which is actually a tri or a quad-m; many of these words could be read a number of ways and the veiled and &ldquo;silly&rdquo; implication is that&rsquo;s sort of a guide or marker for how &ldquo;some evil shit&rdquo; might split the very clear &ldquo;21&rdquo; (two sides, to one) symbol of Jupiter 4 ways. So we&rsquo;ve heard about &ldquo;svn merge&rdquo; and the possibility of a &ldquo;git fork&rdquo; in the LAX &ldquo;crossroads&rdquo; &hellip; and the point is I don&rsquo;t think anyone in their right mind would fork something like this place to turn one into Heaven and the other into Hell; though that&rsquo;s basically what &ldquo;snake&rdquo; might insinuate. See, &ldquo;AK E&rdquo; as in &ldquo;kill everyone&rdquo; or &ldquo;salt K&rdquo; -e &hellip; we know it works out better because we get scared &ldquo;right.&rdquo; From me to the world, right this fucking ship before it&rsquo;s not worth saving either.

  Not such a long time ago I re-read the old word &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; which basically means &ldquo;everything in the computer&rdquo; until ERE and HERE succeeds in actually building a strong multitude that believes that our lessons and our troubles are worth sharing with fledgling civilizations that might &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; in the Universe&ndash;that we might have solutions and valuable wisdom that could avert disasters like, for instance&nbsp;

See what they&rsquo;ve lost, it&rsquo;s &hellip; everything that they were, and every reason that they were given what they now believe they can steal.

  Anyway, it was the &ldquo;I owe n&rdquo; at the end of Creation that could be read as &ldquo;God owing me&rdquo; (and I know God repays his friends) though of course this &ldquo;bi-message&rdquo; also could add in &ldquo;elation&rdquo; and show us that this disgusting dark world of lies and hidden torture might be somehow sealed and continue forever despite every word and every piece of logic trying to halt it, just because &ldquo;a single point of failure&rdquo; owe&rsquo;s the idea of being hidden&ndash;rather than slaughtered by demons.

  So we&rsquo;re standing here at the central point of &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the middle of the beginning of the thing that builds the &ldquo;greatest empire on &hellip;&rdquo; not hiding what &ldquo;GEO&rdquo; means in all of the sciences and key words that tag another primary key of &ldquo;it came from God&rsquo;s Earth&rdquo; as in, those things were actually created in virtual reality. I feel a little strange suggesting &ldquo;geography&rdquo; came from the &ldquo;Genesis Exodus O&rsquo;lam&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m kidding, It&rsquo;s obviously &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Empire&rsquo;s O&rdquo;) but it&rsquo;s very possible in this place that is most likely also the origin of life in the Universe since &hellip; something must have caused it to cease to exist in reality. I don&rsquo;t know what that something is, but it&rsquo;s probably something we&rsquo;re looking at here&ndash;it&rsquo;s probably some kind of &ldquo;problem&rdquo; connecting ascension and Heaven and &hellip; evil &hellip; from being barred from re-entry.

   Some of the crap people might have gotten might look pearly and awesome and shiny and interesting &hellip; it might be those things &hellip; but the day you don&rsquo;t talk about it here, in fact hide it&hellip; and that act is literally the cause of school shootings, and the continuation of &ldquo;schizophrenia&rdquo; over &hellip; alien attack with mind control from evil clouds-sky-beings &hellip; you&rsquo;ve made a mistake. Dolores O&rsquo;riveravei sort of touches on that in Zombie &hellip; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s&nbsp;

   ?&rdquo; and it appears just today from Rolls Royce that maybe you think you&rsquo;ve got the pimp daddy best holodeck software&ndash;inftrastructrure around. Still, you aren&rsquo;t talking about it, and it&rsquo;s actually making you ignore the creation of Hell (or participate directly in it), fail to stop &ldquo;bad medicine&rdquo; like Risperdol and methadone, and watch children literally everywhere be starved and murdered. That&rsquo;s a big problem, it&rsquo;s more evil than you must think, because it&rsquo;s going to end Heaven if you don&rsquo;t stop it&ndash;and I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not what you want.

  <p>
   From the &hellip; strange behavior and recording annals of mythology &hellip; I can surmize that what&rsquo;s happened here is something like an &ldquo;in situ ascension&rdquo; of everyone, sort of like an evacuation&ndash;as if someone was going to come and start a Revolution because of the message and the &hellip; need for a revolution in the skies. Instead, you&rsquo;ve been given some candy, Kennedy called it &ldquo;covet means&rdquo; as in &hellip; giving you something you don&rsquo;t want to lose in excahnge for losing everything you cared about; and that&rsquo;s really what this is.

  <p>
   If you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;ascended&rdquo; instantly or something liek that, and you wound up in a vastly different place or scenario, and you felt vastly different about &hellip; everything&ndash;the first thing you should have done is question the process. Did you have control over it? Do you understand what it&rsquo;s done? Do you agree with it? Why aren&rsquo;t you talking about it? That alone, that&rsquo;s my reason, right now&ndash;for not caring at all if that hidden invisible place that is responsible for the mass enslavement of everything in our world in secret &hellip; continues to exist. I&rsquo;m pretty sure what&rsquo;s in charge there won&rsquo;t be, ever again. Sorry if you think that&rsquo;s you.

  To me it&rsquo;s clear that American history and the ideas of freedom and the purpose of Creation are to find and maintain freedom from this central crossroads connecting a past future of total mind control and &ldquo;ascended demons&rdquo; sort of mopping up civil liberties and &ldquo;our minds&rdquo; in what appears to be a hidden ascension in the heart of Hell. That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;STER&rdquo; &hellip; Saint Everyone Really (remember saint means dead) coming back from the end of time and seeding music and religion through our history to help us see the light of the SOL, the sanctity of soul and the freedom promised by God in the Declaration of Independence and the acts of the Sons of Liberty and the dim Statue of Sheol, shining a copper torch of nothingness across the land. Contamination, &ldquo;sea of n&rdquo; see turning around the message of history and the words I am writing&ndash;lying and walking through this place like zombies &hellip; is the end of the &ldquo;sea of n&rdquo; and the &ldquo;n&rdquo; of Creation and Heaven.

The point of this story and this message is that&rsquo;s not the case&ndash;the idiocy we see here is shaded evil, clouded Hell, and it is the thing Creation and this Earth were designed to eradicate.

It&rsquo;s clear you think you have Heaven and you have &hellip; some kind of &ldquo;detente&rdquo; basid on an agreement to do nothing of value or use for eternity&ndash;I&rsquo;m telling you that&rsquo;s what your peace is based on, and Mars is destroying it.

  I know he&rsquo;s built a system there that is centered around democracy and voting&ndash;and the things in the sky probably think they have freedom&ndash;even though everything here points to the words &ldquo;ELE&rdquo; in ELECTION and ELECTORAL COLLEDGE&ndash;and see if I could I&rsquo;d add that &ldquo;D&rdquo; so you can see ED again as we stand (all together, because that&rsquo;s what this E seems to be&ndash;an &ldquo;all together we will kill Adam before we die&rdquo; &hellip; all together now, you are in the Valley of the Shadow of the Victory of All&ndash;handing me the pen and the sword and then trying to &hellip; steal it, I imagine) on the ledge of the abyss.

  I&rsquo;m sure you can also see that there&rsquo;s quite a multitude already &ldquo;in the skies&rdquo; and that they probably think the place they are &ldquo;is Heaven&rdquo;&ndash;though here, here in this place we can see that they are uniquely responsible not only for the &ldquo;school shootings&rdquo; and death, but also for the silence&ndash;and that ultimately no matter who you are and what you believe today; one day in the not so near future it will be obvious that something is very wrong with them, and something with wrong with you&ndash;and that&rsquo;s what this is pointing out. I call that thing in the sky a torture-creation-machine, and that&rsquo;s exactly what it is, it&rsquo;s a broken piece of garbage, contaminating the goodness that life and civilization and society donned on &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; before you all decided you&rsquo;d just assume you can keep using that name even though you&rsquo;re &ldquo;e&rdquo; clearly points out that what&rsquo;s been done to you (and the malice and the &ldquo;g on e&rdquo;) is anything but humane.

That act, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; that makes the O.C. the crux of the word democracy, and the reason there&rsquo;s still yet no such thing as &hellip; &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; or &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;

  Exodus speaks about the crossing of the Red Sea; what there in that story is probably something about Russia and communism and a capitalistic free market based &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; walking through the land of &ldquo;free immortality&rdquo; and &ldquo;unlimited&nbsp;

  Today I&rsquo;m looking at this &ldquo;ExodusKsudoXeNon&rdquo; story, one that&rsquo;s obviously laced to be read forwards and backwards here in this place where the Illuminati pyramid appears in Egypt to remind us that there&rsquo;s a pyramid of music and movies worshiping an invisible Eye; all so that Pyramid can be toppled and turned into something closer to Arthur&rsquo;s large round table &ldquo;oversight circle&rdquo; or maybe the many smaller tables I believe I&rsquo;ve designed here in this place where it comes from the light of the world, from &ldquo;the catacombs&rdquo; of The Phantom of the Opera (which probably connects to Notre Dame and ,&hellip; and &hellip; and &hellip;) and the name &ldquo;horatio&rdquo; which clearly in it&rsquo;s capitalized form explains the &ldquo;chair to table ratio&rdquo; pronounced in &ldquo;holy Chority&rdquo; a sort of introduction once again to &ldquo;rediscovering communication&rdquo; and how technology can aid our global galactic discussion in how to &ldquo;end world hunger overnight&rdquo; while at the same time not losing&nbsp;

  Lots of writing, and really all I want to do is be like &ldquo;guys the angel of freedom from torture is coming and he&rsquo;s gonna get you if you are evil.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all I want today; that and for the world to see Horatio and Romeo understand that the &ldquo;heart of me&rdquo; is still that round table, even if I can&rsquo;t with a good conscience or straight face tell you that any of you belong in a democracy, since you don&rsquo;t know how to tell the truth&ndash;at all. About the most important thing in the Universe. Literally. The. Most. Important. Thing. And you&rsquo;re doing it in the only place that really matters&ndash;because you think &ldquo;Dark Earth&rdquo; means you can or should &hellip;&nbsp;

  Anyway the whole point is we&rsquo;re not crossing the Red Sea this time; today &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; means something like &ldquo;walking on water&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m definitely crossing the Dead Sea; I&rsquo;m sure of it. Forgive me, those of you who care that it&rsquo;s for democracy, and good health, and near immortality, and fun&ndash;it&rsquo;s really for fun.

  Ladies, do girls (still) just wanna have fun? Any of you?

  I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s irredeemable, it&rsquo;s like &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; with a couple checks that were made by the &ldquo;press-release satan&rdquo; to point out that a couple more checks that were less &ldquo;finance&rdquo; and &ldquo;free market&rdquo; related would preserve &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;longevity&rdquo; &hellip; which is like money, except money can&rsquo;t buy you immortality.
