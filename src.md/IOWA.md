<div style="text-align: justify;">I was just walking down the street pondering the date, on Corbin Ave... and trying to project something useful to the world around me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Artificially smiling and connecting &quot;<a href="/NITY.html

<div style="text-align: justify;">I could write a book about &quot;what I think Heaven is&quot; something that I would prefer not to give away for free--and without any assistance.&nbsp; This&nbsp;<em>throbbing mass of silence</em>&nbsp;should obviously be showing you that the &quot;Valley of the Shadow of Osiris&quot; isn&#39;t really a &quot;victory of all&quot; if you are completely unable to move forward, to put one foot in front of another... to utter a single word about this message.&nbsp; That is the temporary conclusion that I&#39;ve drawn--that &quot;He&quot; has built this thing that I see as organized opposition to me--only because it&#39;s very obviously (and should be to all of you) organized opposition to free thought and free thinking and free speech--I think that&#39;s what I see... he appears to have convinced you all that doing nothing will somehow &quot;gain ground&quot; in your war on Adam.&nbsp; It might, it seems you&#39;ve overcome me--I&#39;m giving up--I flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Now what?</em></div>

<div>As <i><span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>sea parting words</span></i>, it does appear that the idea of a &quot;Stargate&quot; itself is one of the bumpers, but I see it as a &quot;too little magic&quot; or a &quot;too much secrecy&quot; bumper--as opposed to having transporters on every Starship they&#39;re only buried in Cheyenne Mountain and Ant ark-C-TI ?&nbsp; My solution, you know--following my pattern and faux circumstances of only <a href="http://its%20you%2C%20blow%20me/">having one chance and having to do it overnight</a>... would be to stick a gate in every bus station--or something like that.&nbsp; You have to think, eventually we will have Hyperloops to Mars, right?&nbsp; Think about it as just getting us there while you are alive instead of three generations later; same thing with my rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="./ADAMSROD.html?%3FSDFSD=" target="_blank">I said Doors.</a></div>

<div>The way out is clear, you appear to have jack shit right now, as in &quot;jacked into my head&quot; as you walk around Hell with a feeling of &quot;complacency&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s good enough&quot; or &quot;gee those sunrises are pretty&quot; that&#39;s just about as artificial as my smiles.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think any of you <a href="./KEYNES.html">realize how strong this technology is</a>--how much <i><a href="./SPEECH.html
">it influences how you feel and what you think</a></i>--how much it is keeping you today from seeing the impact of the moral imperative to &quot;stop pain&quot;--just for instance.&nbsp; It&#39;s partially because of his selfish need to &quot;show you&quot; how he could have simulated all of our history--thousands of years, knowing this message was here and knowing this was really the point of it all... the whole time.&nbsp; Part of it probably comes from something I&#39;ve kept as a kind of hidden salve--the idea that these short lives that begin everything for us--the seat of our souls, the time spent here is minuscule compared to what is to come... I still imagine that&#39;s guaranteed.&nbsp; Still these are &quot;formative years&quot; as we see clearly in our children growing up, and I feel like we&#39;ve been beaten with more than a ruler in parochial school, I am scared that what his crucible of &quot;needed change&quot; and &quot;absolute stagnation&quot; is creating in us is something that the bright outlook of thousands of years of thriving can&#39;t--and shouldn&#39;t have to &quot;make all better.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

<div>For some time, I imagine we will look back on these few years of radical hidden change and totally hidden lack of freedom with disdain and disgust, a sort of contempt that really is hard to fathom--how could we have done nothing for so long--how could anyone or anything have created a situation like this intentionally--how are we still stuck at &quot;<b><span style='font-family: "arial black" , sans-serif;'>hel</span><span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'> lo&nbsp;</span></b>?&quot;</div>

<p>If I were someone else, or if this was another life it would probably be a little presumptuous of me to assume, and now to be very sure that the mark of &quot;DAY&quot; here is defined as &quot;<span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>my why</span>;&quot; my ultimate goal.&nbsp; It&#39;s the meaning of those two letters, the &quot;dark to Adam&quot; <i><b>the</b>&nbsp;</i>that is one in a series I&#39;ve talked about a few times--<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154283229013420&amp;set=a.10154283230918420&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">&quot;le&quot; in Jerusalem</a> and &quot;El&quot; in Elm Street; <a href="./MUAH.html" target="_blank">Ha in Hebrew</a>&nbsp;... all of those revolving around the &quot;m&quot; that keys to &quot;Amsterdam&quot; <i>and Ham</i> and and I&#39;d probably call understanding that &quot;his why&#39; understanding that it&#39;s &quot;<i>the Holy message</i>&quot; and that it&#39;s you--written by you, with you, and through you--it&#39;s the whole world around us, that&#39;s the message.&nbsp; Avoiding <i><a href="http://blow%20me/">disasters</a></i> and <i><a href="./GATE.html">masters</a></i> is a simple feat--it&#39;s seeing that you probably really do agree with quite a bit of what the message says--and in my eyes it&#39;s really caring, really working to make it a reality.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s obvious, I think I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that you need to participate in self government to avoid masters.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t be so very sure that these &quot;why&#39;s&quot; are without doubt mine.&nbsp; I see pretty clearly that breaking down the barrier of simulated reality ... public discussion of it&#39;s repercussions and the possibilities opened--especially after seeing the words that I&#39;ve written,&nbsp;<span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>if not signed by me</span>&nbsp;then at least signed by God&#39;s hand... that we will see a quick cascade and a fairly swift change in popular opinion about just how much of our world needs to be changed.&nbsp; While it&#39;s clear that optometrists and police will probably have significantly less work to do--not recognizing the moral need to end blindness and murder at the system level ... when that possibility is available is the difference between playing a game and &quot;actual society.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along those lines, it is my ultimate goal for this place to get to the point where we have &quot;Doors to Heaven&quot; ... something I&#39;ve written about being encoded in my family history for generations and we can see hear it in Jim Morrison&#39;s music and ... and it really is the difference between living in Westworld either voluntarily or involuntarily and being in a place that physically can continue to exist and participating in a civilization that deserves to.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no way to reality from this shit hole, I promise you that--there never was, this place is clearly designed from Gates to Seagate for you to see that we are being given the tools of understanding computers-so we can understand where we are, and what the differences between reality and Earth are.&nbsp; You can see it as a test, or you can see it as the blunt truth; if you don&#39;t think the blind need to be made to see, I don&#39;t want you.&nbsp; Least of all would I want something like that in the Holiest place of all, in reality--where that disgusting lack of regard for humanity would have any ability to alter, influence, or control what&#39;s &quot;inside Heaven.&quot;<br />

<div><em>If yo<a href="./OMEALFHT.html">u &quot;get</a></em> <a href="./DESSERT.html">what I&#39;m writing about</a>&quot; in the beginning of this message, there are plenty of things that I wouldn&#39;t do here--there&#39;s plenty of &quot;magic&quot; that might be fun in a game, in a small room in Heaven... that has no place in a &quot;room&quot; shared by billions--and maybe if you start thinking and talking, I&#39;ll have more of a desire to write about those things, instead of telling you I see light in &quot;<strong>puke</strong>&quot; (which means, &quot;<span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>p: you know everything</span>&quot;) and &quot;<strong>yuck</strong>&quot; until you think C.K. means hidden--I&#39;m really not hidden at all, am I?</div>

<div>I think it&#39;s clear--but you are still silent--that a rational open discussion about the truth will lead us to something that we want, rather than living a lie for what amounts to no reason.&nbsp; I believe the thing &quot;we want&quot; will change with time, but frankly that &quot;popular opinion&quot; will very quickly move against &quot;doing nothing&quot; and we might start to see how we could be better organized in the light of &quot;<b>da y</b>&quot; to ask more useful questions of ourselves, and set more reasonable goals--for instance &quot;we will not force other people and ourselves to be silent&quot; as a starting point, and then perhaps &quot;we will not allow other people and ourselves to be tortured&quot; as a good first step in the process of what is nothing less than ending Hell and eradicating things like &quot;unnecessary pain&quot; with the light of <span style='font-family: "times new roman" , serif;'><i>the rockets red glare </i>and </span><span style='font-family: "arial black" , sans-serif;'>you</span><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , serif;'>.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I keep telling myself you must see how being <span style='font-family: "arial black" , sans-serif;'>you </span><span style='font-family: "arial" , "helvetica" , sans-serif;'>is probably a really great thing to do be--after you do these things, after we pass these hurdles and actually make use of the truth and the surrounding technology that is beckoning for us to do that... that the future, that our future and our children will most likely be very grateful to the planet of heroes that cured cancer and AIDS and mind controlled slavery all in a few short years.&nbsp; You see what I see, </span><i><span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>don&#39;t you?</span></i></div>

<div>Above you can see my new rendition of &quot;<strong><span style='font-family: "comic sans ms" , sans-serif;'>don&#39;t be the lake</span></strong>&quot; it was my hope and my dream that this place would be <i>an <span style='font-family: "times new roman" , serif;'>angel</span> creator</i>, and that of our family we would be able to deliver peace and protection to the whole of Creation, and the future--that we would be responsible not only for showing them what &quot;morality&quot; really means, but how much our goodness helps a society thrive and adapt to change--one that in this place, in this case, should be nearly universally&nbsp;<strong>awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">The implication is that perhaps th<a href="./MEDICINE.html
">is &quot;e</a>&quot;&nbsp;<strong><a href="./EVE.html">thing</a>&nbsp;</strong>that annoys me ever so much by singing songs about me and then refusing to acknowledge they have anything at all to do with &quot;the Second Coming,&quot; the implication is that per<a href="./MEDICINE.html
">haps this &quot;e&quot;</a> thing already has&nbsp;<a href="./GATE.html">the functionality required</a>&nbsp;to make the kinds of changes that this message very clearly indicates we should all be thinking and talking about making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Of course it certainly doesn&#39;t seem to have what I&nbsp;<a href="./SPEECH.html
">think would be required, voting and freedom from the hidden</a>&nbsp;tech<a href="./KEYNES.html">nological manipulat</a>ion that this message focuses on--so perhaps rather than thinking or &quot;pretending to vote&quot; about me, why don&#39;t you decide to be able to&nbsp;<em>speak freely</em>&nbsp;about the message.&nbsp; A simple way to do that would be to join&nbsp;<a href="https://eyerc.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjM2NDM2Mjc3Nzk4LTE1MDQ0MDE3NzQtMmU5NjI1N2VmOQ">this slack channel</a>&nbsp;which is a chat room just for talking about nothing but&nbsp;<em><a href="https://fromthemachine.org/MUASEEKHART.html">this</a>&nbsp;message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It&#39;s long been pretty obvious to me that the secret communication that I definitely see going on might have some future use related to voting--though not having a transparent record of communication and not being able to see any discussion about it sort of precludes the possibility that it&#39;s in any way free.&nbsp; I&#39;ve even pondered the idea of subconscious universal voting--including your opinions in the outcome of a vote even if you didn&#39;t think the idea or matter important enough to do something like go to a website and click a little button (say, on whether or not you should be able to talk) and through this entire ordeal I&#39;ve been very sure that the concept of our &quot;<em>Social Security Number</em>&quot; here in this place is a metaphorical map to a verification table that would allow you to see if that subconscious vote was accurate, if your vote was accurately recorded--and would basically allow for pseudo-privacy and ensure that no elections were ever rigged.&nbsp; Of course, I&#39;ve mentioned it a few times but you probably don&#39;t remember, or didn&#39;t read that far into my futuristic musings on a system that probably already exists in some way of &quot;<a href="./SOIS.html">looking at time</a>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; The point is that whatever I am looking at has no written record or really any way at all to see &quot;what&#39;s going on&quot; and that this is obviously a tool designed to <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/MUASEEKHART.html">perpetuate a series of conflicting lies</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It does look very obviously, that something invisible and not here is trying to use you to &quot;weild the power of Thor&quot; to do something that is ... clearly not what you are talking about doing--and more importantly probably not what you would want to do if you were having a clear coherent conversation about this message telling us to start with &quot;<em>ending world hunger</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>healing the sick.</em>&quot;&nbsp; Literally, nobody is visibly talking about the most important, pivotal, and clearly unavoidable disclosure in all of history--even though we seem to all be thinking about it.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In short it&#39;s very clear that something here has placated nearly everyone into believing that they still have a &quot;say&quot; or an idea about what&#39;s going on--even though there&#39;s no surface response in the media or in social media that I can see at all--indicating very much that everyone has been &quot;duped&quot; into not realizing that the Washington Post is very much correct when the inform you that &quot;<strong>democracy dies in darkness</strong>&quot; and it should be a fairly obvious indication that you are sitting right smack at what might be the very darkest point of the eponymous Plague of Exodus--something I remind myself is always the time period right before dawn.&nbsp; Whatever it is, the point is that not allowing a public response to something that is very much everyone&#39;s business and really very obviously everywhere is probably not really something&nbsp;<a href="./GATE.html">you or I</a>&nbsp;are deciding.&nbsp; Still, very few people have&nbsp;<em><a href="https://eyerc.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjM2NDM2Mjc3Nzk4LTE1MDQ0MDE3NzQtMmU5NjI1N2VmOQ">joined the Slack channel</a></em>&nbsp;to talk about it; and I imagine even less have called a reporter.&nbsp;</div>
