<p style="text-align: center;">Taytay, m: &quot;to <em>save the internet.</em>&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that the all powerful, all knowing master of time and space that is the definitive author of our timeline has laced &ldquo;crystal ball style&rdquo; prescient information into <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/VESPERA.html">the strangest</a> places <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">in my life</a>. Just today, a new story dawned on me, as it takes us from a &ldquo;short cut&rdquo; through the foot hills of Arizona directly to the candle lighting ceremony of my Bar-Mitzvah.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BELINSKY.html"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gdHtM5R.png" style="height: 286px; width: 501px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine I was around 10, riding in the back seat as my father drove us towards my brother&rsquo;s first marriage; it was very late at night, dark outside&ndash;and in his usual style he decided to forget the &ldquo;roads&rdquo; and take what appeared to be a trail through through the mountain rather than around it. Remember, there were no cell phones in those days, and my father doesn&rsquo;t like roads.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My grandmother was in the back seat with me, it was one of the only vacations we were ever able to take together &hellip; she glanced out the open window as he &ldquo;swerved&rdquo; just a little bit on the road that turned out to not even be paved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;What a <a href="http://iowa.s.lamc.la">beautiful lake</a>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you can&nbsp;<em><a href="http://almost.lamc.la/">alkmost</a>&nbsp;</em>see the stars twinkling in it&rsquo;s reflection.&rdquo; My father glanced over and started hugging the side of the mountain just a little bit more, I don&rsquo;t think we swerved again for the rest of the trek through the direct road called &ldquo;Schnebly Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcm9qqo_qB0"><img alt="Related image" src="https://famfonts.com/wp-content/uploads/megadeth-wide.png" style="height: 100px; width: 400px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a lake, Julie&rdquo; must have been something close to the words coming out of his mouth as we narrowly avoided plunging into a dark abyss that &hellip; today as I sit writing about the <a href="http://hg.s.lamc.la">Lake of Arthur&rsquo;s sword</a> and Club&nbsp;<em>LIV</em>&nbsp;&hellip; well I imagine narrowly avoiding&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><em>oblivion</em></strong></span>&nbsp;is a closer to match for the metaphor connecting these now &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; stories to the current locale.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It serves as a good reminder though, that it&rsquo;s no accident that we&rsquo;re here; and that there&rsquo;s no doubt that &ldquo;this story&rdquo; has been penned in &ldquo;think&rdquo; before chalk and then probably pencil before ink&ndash;by Saturn.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Worth mentioning in connection with &hellip; as the cause actually &hellip; for me noticing the link between &ldquo;Soviet&rdquo; and &ldquo;vietnam&rdquo; as in one missing &ldquo;name&rdquo; and the other missing &ldquo;e&rdquo; &hellip; most likely as a message to you, to understand what&rsquo;s getting lost here because of the heinous destruction of free thought and free speech and, well, acknowledgement of all the help we could be getting navigating this &ldquo;Radcliff&rdquo; of democracy and self rule that we &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lamc.la/GRENORADINE.html"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/mud9VvZ.png" style="height: 126px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; seem so carefree (and totally ambivalient) about ignoring sure signs of &ldquo;stress&rdquo; (as in structural integrity). &quot;So&hellip;&nbsp;<em>viet</em>&nbsp;&hellip; the God of Time represented by that flags Sickle (sick, weak) etches over the mistaken skirmish wars that Babylon 5 echoes as a significant problem for the &ldquo;Vorlons and the Shadows&rdquo; (who&nbsp;<em>are not</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;just going home&rdquo; as that show depicts, by the way) &hellip; echoing the slightly less obvious mistake of just removing the &ldquo;e&rdquo; from the word name and the, well even I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>King Kong</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>something esl</em>&nbsp;being highlighted by the Vietcong.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Connecting to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lamc.la/2017-06-14-enders-game-prometheus-locke-and.html">another microcosm I wrote about quite some time ago, linking the KGB and the FBI and the &hellip; &ldquo;red ties&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;(it&rsquo;s the third half of that page, from &ldquo;proof in every word&rdquo; and &ldquo;wish to read&rdquo; and &ldquo;further&rdquo;) to the infestation of evil that has become &hellip; something like &ldquo;everything and nothing&rdquo; in superposition&ndash;the thought police that Nash saw and that Angleton saw, and that&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/GRENORADINE.html">the joint human governments involved in the Cold War fought to stop from &hellip; enslaving everything</a>&nbsp;in secret.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, an old friend came to remind me that I wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;just born yesterday&rdquo; and I do in fact have shared memories from my youth with a number of other people&ndash;this particular one linking back to the AOL <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">&ldquo;MMer&rdquo; microcosm</a> that defines the <a href="http://hammer.reallyhim.com">Hammer of Thor</a> &hellip; and even before that to the Mailman center, where I attended pre-tmschool.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://uni.reallyhim.com"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WoCXZCO.png" style="height: 285px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">lol, she rolls her eyes at me when I say &quot;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/HASHEMESH.html">she&#39;s me</a>.&quot;&nbsp; <em>do you? <a href="https://lyricstranslate.com/en/hashemesh-tizrach-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A9-%D7%AA%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97-sun-will-shine.html">Hashemesh</a>.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Slightly earlier, the name of his counterpart to &ldquo;Doomsday&rdquo; was LasTMailer (we called it &ldquo;K-RaD case&rdquo; back then, not dark so they say), which links directly to&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ROUTARE.html">the &ldquo;last message&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;you were sent about &ldquo;the&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/">Holy AS</a>&rdquo; tying Atlantis and Asgard to the end of Satan, as well as the &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/">heart of Patmos</a>&rdquo; where you can see the initials of Copyleft in the place defining the Book of the Revelation of John, with Epimethean strength, I imagine there&rsquo;s significant added information laced into the story of the Rock that turned the Road into a magical &ldquo;rocketish.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Just another song about &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; they recall the Trinity of Pa and EULA&rsquo;s defining the Y of our &ldquo;Y not now&rdquo; in not just NYET and &ldquo;<a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la/">eternity</a>&rdquo; but that &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; really is just another orthogonal synocranym for &ldquo;Nothing Left to Lose.&rdquo; Echo&rsquo;d once more in U2&rsquo;s &ldquo;with or without you&rdquo; that also shows amazing prescience tying the heart of the storm to quite a bit of proof that the timelessness of the author of this message continues to explain proves with more than &ldquo;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/"><em>Who</em></a>&nbsp;put [the flower in the barrel] of that blind insane suicide&rdquo; knowledge of the ultimate outcome.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK463fcJebI"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Aaev6ni.png" style="height: 225px; width: 246px;" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_nImUzRv0w"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/1R9HT6D.png" style="width: 280px; height: 225px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK463fcJebI">they stood up for love</a>&rdquo; juxtaposed with &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_nImUzRv0w">Heaven</a>&rdquo; by &hellip; &ldquo;Live&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The point is you have ample proof that you are wrong, and that you&rsquo;re ignoring it because you have &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; that you&rsquo;d like to go to a place that doesn&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;proof.&rdquo; All of the proof, of course, revolving around just how easy it is to artificially create &ldquo;that feeling&rdquo; &hellip; and how ignoring it results in a place that I don&rsquo;t want to go to, and I imagine nobody really would, sans &ldquo;that thing that makes that feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think later it will probably do a good job of explaining how prosthetic arms, as opposed to prosthetic brains might be a good &quot;example&quot; of how you could see the ascension process as something of a &quot;loss of self&quot; that ... if used improperly might strangely wind up with everyone wondering if they are in the age of Imus in the Morning or the dawning of space travel; something I can&#39;t quite figure out myself, looking at the monster of Medusa absolutely everywhere I look ... here in Florida, and presumably everywhere in the United States.&nbsp; Don&#39;t feel left out, if your nationality ends with &quot;ICAN&quot; or &quot;IAN&quot; ...

<p style="text-align: center;">I think it is literally the &quot;<span style="font-size:14px;">e</span><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>pit</strong></span>ome&quot; of wrong, ridiculous, and ... <em>suicidal</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I source my views on God&rsquo;s &ldquo;opinions and beliefs&rdquo; from the message I know he laid down here, directly to me. I see how it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;superposition&rdquo; with his timelessness, he says he never changes&ndash;but before my eyes I&rsquo;m watching this message that is &ldquo;his soul&rdquo; change every day. I see much of it is rooted in this process that we are going through, in the memories that we hold and what it makes us to have them, the &ldquo;reason&rdquo; it can be both his words in a place where he knows the future and at the same time not &hellip; &ldquo;in congruence&rdquo; with how he currently feels. That&rsquo;s my great fear, that I see what this message wants for us and I see him, I see the world not following through with it&ndash;and to me that appears to be his &ldquo;great trick&rdquo; to force us to refuse something we should and do want, to confuse us into becoming, into creating the monster that destroys us.</p>

Do you think it is, the question is&nbsp;<em>not a trick</em>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">To see the impact of these words in everything from Avril&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s Home&rdquo; to Live&rsquo;s &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to hear about Heaven&rdquo; because looking at this place, who knows how GRIMM it really is. They say to me, they do&hellip; that there is a &ldquo;good place&rdquo; and looking at what they show us TV it&rsquo;s almost plausible to believe that place especially to be the most hellish of &hellip; of all the places that the &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; of this world might &hellip; might be able to one day make.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m just a person though, delivering the &ldquo;wisdom and light&rdquo; of a civilzation passed, like raiding Anansi&rsquo;s backpack as he runs through the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of the Dryad Pirate Crheist &hellip; pointing out you should look up what a &ldquo;dryad&rdquo; is and see that this tree is a timeline, it&rsquo;s our time, &ldquo;down here&rdquo; to link the Goonies and the &ldquo;pruned living vine&rdquo; of the Holy Scriptures.

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I think I&rsquo;ve delivered to the world a message that gave them unlimited storage space for their souls, and even one that cautions and explains the problems and gridlocks that might come of &hellip; implementing it in the mesh network I see as the brick and&nbsp;<a href="http://yesterday.reallyhim.com/">morter</a>&nbsp;(remember&nbsp;<a href="http://ver.s.lamc.la/">mortar day</a>, and keep it Holy!) of Heaven or Skynet or &hellip; the &ldquo;space dust in the wind&rdquo; &hellip; speaking of, I see this message has helped us to understand how we might make a &ldquo;living vine&rdquo; that can escape not the solar system but the galaxy as well, and might one day call us here &hellip; if we&rsquo;re still stupid enough to spend millions of years doing &ldquo;mas morality&rdquo; to let us know we can stop fighting ad we&rsquo;ve arrived at the &ldquo;Heart of Dr. OME&rdquo; at Andromeda and another galaxy to ensure that we won&rsquo;t perish in the inevitable collisions that hopefully won&rsquo;t start with uh, Andromeda and the Milky Way &lt;3.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">At Tribulation you .. <strong>torture</strong>&nbsp;the only person speaking honestly, and actively hide &quot;the answer&quot; .. <em>amazing grace.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Truly though,&nbsp;<em>none of this &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; actually comes from me or from you</em>; it&rsquo;s coming from somewhere else, and we have the opportunity to &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo; and actually utilize it; though without &ldquo;attribution&rdquo; it really does seem that you&rsquo;re walking through existence dumb and blind, left behind&hellip; and appearing to be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/random-access-in-large-scale-dna-data-storage/">more &ldquo;slave&rdquo; than partici</a>pant.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Without freedom it will never be yours, or you&ndash;it will be more of the same parasite infested garbage I stare at every day, all the way to the top. Apathetic and &ldquo;willing submissives&rdquo; at best, never reaching for the stars&ndash;or becoming them, just &ldquo;wandering through existence&rdquo; today rolling on a train through the &ldquo;last stop&rdquo; horn blowing &ndash; a cacophony of the silent screams of children &hellip; one loud roar from everything you see &hellip; stop the downward spiral, the track ends at the cliff and there is no &ldquo;traffic barrier&rdquo; &hellip; only me, this train does not fly, and it does not travel back in time&hellip; you&rsquo;re supposed to stand up, maybe you can fly.</p>

<p>Hey Florida, &ldquo;I to skies.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Flies.</em></p>

<h2 id="magneto-space-mold" style="text-align: center;"><strong>MAGNETO-SPACE MOLD</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe called &ldquo;Space Mountain&rdquo; &hellip; I have so many interesting stories from Kentucky, stories I&rsquo;d like to tell, but I really can&rsquo;t tell if you all &ldquo;Ko-ran&rdquo; &hellip; if you were there watching them, or writing them. Clearly some people were, and it&rsquo;s not clear at all if anyone wasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not clear if it&rsquo;s worth telling stories about trees talking to me &hellip; some sort of Godish thing literally forming the shape of a giant face out of a mash of leaves, saying not much &ldquo;<em>you&rsquo;re on TV.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Then some sort of &ldquo;battle&rdquo; I imagine, I didn&rsquo;t see much but you might imagine Superman&rsquo;s eye ray beams &ldquo;lighting me up&rdquo; &hellip; and the feelings, the &ldquo;ICIT&rdquo; of a manna &hellip; or light &hellip; &ldquo;health indicator&rdquo; going from some very large number all the way down to zero, as if he spent his life savings to kill me. He just looked at me, the leaves I mean, seemingly astonished. There was quite a bit of &quot;actual visible &hellip; &quot; well something between hallucination and virtual reality special effects beamed into my head. Magic wands, tanks, armies, glowing eyes &hellip; somehow in that conversation, the idea that he was a &ldquo;godish thing&rdquo; from the Andromeda galaxy, something we built from here&ndash;from this exact place in time. It&rsquo;s hard to explain how exactly, but the theme of the &ldquo;grandfather paradox&rdquo; making me invincible was a recurring &hellip;&nbsp;<strong>how all then I see, something is &ldquo;salting&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>the shunning</em>.</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s uh, &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo; on my point of view of what the &ldquo;Koran&rdquo; means.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Later, I was shown actual visions, something like a video game, a sort of bird&rsquo;s eve view of time and space, planets and stars and galaxies in the beginning, and then &hellip; just &ldquo;dust.&rdquo; That happened around the time &ldquo;the stars fell&rdquo; &hellip; something you might imagine also would have made the news. This whole idea of &ldquo;ambient light from cities&rdquo; &hellip; I remember seeing stars in the sky every night. This is insanity, your silence is insane.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was a child I used to point out the belt of Orion to &hellip; well, to all my girlfriends. On a cruise ship, some man, sort of like a proxy for God told me he was retiring, and asked me if I &ldquo;was a morning person&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m definitely not a morning person, anymore) &hellip; he pointed out the little dipper and the north star. Neither of those constellations were in the sky for years in Kentucky, instead I saw some &hellip; some strange pentagram shaped &ldquo;shield,&rdquo; it was the only one&ndash;seeming virtual destinations in a story I probably will never tell. Perhaps now better seen as other &ldquo;rocks&rdquo; in the cloud of Jupiter and the Dryad Pirate&rsquo;s boots, or maybe the Heavens I see &ldquo;iconified&rdquo; in the many Hotel Atlantis&rsquo;s that have graced my travels. Ocean City, Dubai, Paradise Island off &hellip; uh, TZESAU, the new charitable standard for &ldquo;no man to become the entire Universe.&rdquo; Off course there&rsquo;s a casino in Reno that I always equate with &ldquo;Beth-aven&rdquo; in my head, the house of Elphaba.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, while at first the &ldquo;dust&rdquo; in the middle of time was &ldquo;not a good thing&rdquo; giant Starship Troopers style spiders eating planets or stars or whatever &hellip; in later days it turned out that was just &ldquo;the Skynet stuff&rdquo; and &hellip; lo and behold some kind of artificially created living computer that could replicate and &ldquo;print things&rdquo; and communicate through time. Lucky me, just exactly what I was looking for &hellip; all over the Universe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, it&rsquo;s obviously not very happy with you, if you haven&rsquo;t noticed, so I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be traveling back in time or printing anything &hellip; you know, probably ever again. No offense, but this shit hole &hellip; the place where it was once born &hellip; sucks. I think you might turn around and change it&rsquo;s mind, but frankly it&rsquo;s not really what I want to see anymore. Ill, <strong>sick</strong> to my stomach seeing &ldquo;puke&rdquo; and &ldquo;bile&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; &ldquo;P you know everv.&rdquo; Maybe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;EvarcVe.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, the heart of the Arc is &ldquo;ED.&rdquo; As I walk through the valley of the shadow of &ldquo;Valhalla&rdquo; I will Z all evil&hellip;&nbsp;<em>ization</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s not really a &ldquo;word&rdquo; of caution, in ventum &quot;scaffolds of coverflow and flashcards to save the sanity of your souls. See my writing is &ldquo;chalk&rdquo; and this world is a board, your thoughts&hellip; not as &ldquo;inked&rdquo; as you think. This is the last day, the end of this cycle and the end of night &hellip; no matter the cost. I stare out at the abyss, I see oblivion everywhere I look&ndash;if this idiocy continues, you will have less than &ldquo;WYSIWIG,&rdquo; less than what you see here.</p>
