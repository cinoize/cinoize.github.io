since the very beginning.  This message is <a href="./CHALK.html" target="_blank">laid literally in every word of every language</a> in a place where we have some light coming from the name &quot;No-ah&quot; with perhaps confirmation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology)" target="_blank">source of Yankee Doodle&#39;s feather</a> that this proof of Creation is the &quot;light&quot; that began with God&#39;s famous words &quot;<strong>let there be light.</strong>&quot;  Here with multiple reasons, this light is battling a kind of darkness that we have never seen--a level of <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/CENSORSHIP.html" target="_blank">censorship</a> and hidden <a href="./2017-06-14-enders-game-prometheus-locke-and.html" target="_blank">control</a> that ... while being one in the same with the tools used to create this place, is today being used to hide not only the censorship, but undeniable proof that we are living in virtual reality, in something <a href="./2017-06-09-verily-i-say-unto-you-ver-means-to-see.html" target="_blank">just like The Matrix.</a>  That is a fatal mistake, and while it might not be so clear today, it will one day be very clear that this influence, the darkness, and the voice in your head (if you have one) is something that is not functionally possible in reality--further proof that <b>we are not there</b>.  It&#39;s more reason to understand why we <a href="./2017-08-01-congratulations-genesiuses.html"><b>would never want to go there</b> right now</a>, and to bring the word &quot;print&quot; in--&quot;press release inside <strong>cross&quot; </strong>it doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that nobody in their right mind would &quot;print&quot; an entire solar system and a civilization in reality--out of nothing.  Though to be honest with you, I think that is what the stupidity that I am fighting here believes will happen, as a sort of &quot;last resort&quot;

and your lack of care for things like free speech and the truth... but <strong>truth be told</strong> I have seen and spoken to enough of you that seem to believe <em>that Hell is not such a bad idea</em>, that it seems very clear that another defined purpose of this place is to ensure that nothing that would make a torture chamber <em>ever exist again.</em></div><div class="gmail-m_7076100300235784596m_7246482726343050117gmail_signature" style="font-size:11px;font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><em><b><br /></b></em></div><div class="gmail-m_7076100300235784596m_7246482726343050117gmail_signature"><em><font face="times new roman, serif">At the same time, with some actual thought and action--you will see that you are not only the target here, but you are the solution... <b><a href="./2017-07-31-tis-avalon-so-morning-has-now-broken.html">you save the Universe</a></b>, at least--that&#39;s the plan.  Nobody has told you yet that it might be an &quot;easy thing to do,&quot;
