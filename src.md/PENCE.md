<div align="justify">Basically what you've been looking at is
tacit, incontrovertible and slightly controversial proof that we
are living in virtual reality, that the Matrix was something
closer to a documentary than fiction; and that it's part of a
message woven throughout our art and history designed to help
you swiftly change the entire world--and the course of
history.&nbsp; I really suggest you begin trying to do that, as
it's very clear from the visible response coming from people I
see and even from major media corporations and governments that
you very clearly "see the message" and that you simply believe
the best course of action, right this moment, is for you to
pretend you are stupid.&nbsp; I disagree, I think the collective
feigned stupidity in the world today is causing a significant
amount of hardship and torture ... torture of those people that
have incurable or debilitating diseases, other maladies, and
frankly every single one of you that are right this moment
watching your bodies simulate aging in a process that ultimately
ends in the simulation of your death--all in the hopes that by
some miracle the great organization responsible for creating
this torture chamber will one day around your death or perhaps
significantly in the future see fit to follow this map to
salvation and raise the dead--in Heaven.&nbsp; It shouldn't take
much thought for you to put together the idea that you might not
want to go the place that's responsible for building this
crucible ... in order to avoid a much worse future that they
probably experienced, and most likely because of the same kind
of mass stupidity that you see around you today.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It's probably really very clear to you already, but for the sake
of argument let's assume you actually are very
stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure how many people you
think you are right now, but it seems very clear to me that I am
not just a single person--and that your silence and lack of
"regard" for your own well being--specifically seizing this
opportunity to become the most famous and lauded generation that
has ever existed (by abolishing ridiculous things like slavery,
disease, pain, and tyranny... one an for all time, beginning
with "<i>Hey Mess</i>" and ending with your immortal fame...
with probably some ZE&nbsp; (as in not so easy) work in the
meantime) ... anyway your silence and lack of interest in
destroying your own chains (which it should be clear actually
responding to this message catalyzes... the beginning of "true
freedom") and in actually seeing Heaven before you die ... well,
you'd probably imagine how that makes it look like there's some
other person or thing hiding inside you and making what amounts
to a "no brainer" something you simply don't see clear enough to
react to. <br />
<br />
I've spent quite a bit of time detailing the rules and lexicon
of this hidden language that today begins with the idea that "d
is cl" case closed; functional ideas you can see proof of Holy
Intent in in names like "Metatron" which suggests the "TA" of
tacit has something to do with Bonnie Tyler's song "Turn Around"
(f/k/a The Total Eclipse of the Heart) to see how "north"
appears magically from Megatron's tome an also how you can see
the "city" and it's heart have something to do with Nike's "Just
Do Me &lt;3" and this very auspicious period connecting Auden
and "audacity" to a message woven through time and space from
the hubris of Kismet to the SOAD song "Toxicity" and even
Britney Spears recent retake on the idea that "to kiss, I see"
is not quite as toxic as you thought, and she's busy calling
everyone via the Spears-MTV-"phone of destiny."&nbsp; Turn
around, and C IT, see the city actually painted on our sky and
see it from the inside--as it's Holy Purpose is to help us see
that these changes are not only inevitable but mandatory and
that not being able to walk to Heaven would be something like
staring at a fossil record containing hundreds of thousands of
airplanes and a society that has no desire to fly anywhere
because it's "just not Wright to change the world."<br />

<div align="justify">I've written several hundred email
messages--disseminated them to hundreds of thousands of
people--and even took the time to bind a few selected messages
in books, so that you might have some way to purchase something
to commemorate that actual thing that began changing the world
and turning Hell into Heaven.&nbsp; Above is the cover art from
the latest work, focusing on the fairly clear idea that the <i>WINE</i>
of Jesus Christ has something to do with "systems
interoperability" (WINE, for those of you that don't know is a
Unix like compatibility layer to allow Microsoft Windows code to
run natively through simulation inside a non Windows system) and
the ability to manipulate the simulated raelity we find all
around us in order to bring some Heavenly Magic to Earth.&nbsp;
I hope you believe in that stuff, because I see it every day in
everything from "<a href="./ALLTA.html">dose

bkha</a>" to <i>Magic</i> <a href="./DICK.html
">Johnson</a>,
and I can't imagine waiting another day to start trying to cure
AIDS and Cancer <a href="http://fromthemachineorg/OCADSWAY.html">and the loss of
limbs and life</a> for everyone who is being tortured today by
what appears to be a conspiratorial <a href="./XOXO.html">collective</a> of former humans
who want nothing more than to pretend they are too stupid to <a href="./CURE.html
">connect "book of Names" with AIDS
and Hi-five</a> or the <a href="./HASHEMESHB.html
">Burning Bush
of Exodus with George Bush</a>.&nbsp; One more time, Exodus
means Names in Hebrew--and as you stare up at the sky from this
place where God has named "DOWN Syndrome" to remind everyone
that the Hell you find yourselves in something that no
intelligent or humane person or entity would create--really see
he's telling you if you want to send anyone to Hell--you are
fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I suggest the last two books ... as being the
most complete and engaging--if you were interested in buying a
little piece of history, and keeping a conspiracy of
inaction--this circle of ignorance and palpable evil from being
able to starve me to death for the service I've done for the
world analyzing this message and literally blowing the wind and
the sea towards Heaven with these messages which are very
clearly designed by <a href="./WHO.html
">the Time
Lord Dr. Who</a> with prescient knowledge of the barricade to
progress and whatever invisible ideas and insane set of precepts
must be common place in the "skies above" as they continue to
force us farther and farther down into this nebulous bottom of
everything--this place where we appear to be ignoring <a href="TY.html">the most interesting
message ever received by SETI or by the NSA, the Vatican or
GCHQ</a>--a message explaining that we are living in the most
exciting time that has ever been; a place where the "skies
above" are going to help us change the world. <br />
<br />
While it may not be obvious from the writing I've done so far, I
don't particularly think the place helping to write this message
is Heaven--at least not where I'd like to spend a few thousand
years, and it appears to me very clear that the inhabitants
helping to weave together the tapestry of the gODorgons (from
their own ...&nbsp; pasts) have become something closer to
partially-blind and partially bound-Holodecks than people, and I
think they've skipped over "<a href="./bethesda.reallyhim.com"><i>all

the fun</i></a>" that we could be having making an actual
working civilization from this place--rather than a network of
rooms-that-once-were-people and calling it "a higher
society."&nbsp; It appears clear from what I see around me that
we're all getting some kind of quickening--a giant leap towards
being OK with not just be ourselves but also having an external
influence hammering away at our desires; and it's probably that
loss of individuality and free will that ... gone unseen in this
place because of ... total darkness through mind control and
censorship ... that we've missed out on ever actually <a href="./ADAMSROD.html
">building a place that is anything
close to Heaven</a>.&nbsp; I'd like to point out that we
wouldn't be here hearing about how we're all being tortured by
"simulated reality" and by a desire to hide a very obvious
message linking Shakespeare to Herod to Napoleon (lots of polls
... <i>there</i>) to the idea that God's will is coming to us
from Huxley and from Orwell and from the foundational beliefs
and principles that founded America as a sort of weapon against
"hidden possession" a la the slavery being destroyed by the book
of Exodus.<br />

<br />
<div align="justify">FU KU, SH IM A; flip upsidown the coup, and
see how I'm A--at least that's what the message about the
earthquake that named a band and defined a series of "11 for K"
numerical patterns tying REM's "It's the beginning of Heaven and
you should believe it" to the very clear and still unspoken idea
that just like we shouldn't have stood by and watched 9/11
happen, we shouldn't have watched 3/11 happen, or the series of
storms that sunk New Orleans and ... and all of it really
circling around the idea that there is a heinous amount of
censorship and lack of truth being discussed--that none of us
would have wanted these events to happen--and yet we are still
standing by in silence as little children are being shot in
schools by mind controlled assassins ... all because we can't
seem to wrap our heads around the idea that we need to "talk"
about this message in order to actually implement Neo's
disappearing bullets and Minority Report and a system of safety
that I do see becoming the de facto standard in the
Universe--just as soon as we figure out how to do it
properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really important to see that even
worse than the bullets and even worse than the hurricanes and
the earthquakes are the hidden chains of mental slavery that are
causing this message that pervades so many bands and songs and
movies (and every word) from actually making news and changing
the world.&nbsp; It's the slavery, that's the real problem; and
that's really the focus of the emancipation that is Exodus and
the defining turning point our world creates--throughout
Creation--to enforce this idea that our minds are sacred and
that "possession" and other kinds of hidden external influence
shouldn't be the kind of thing we have to be plagued with
worrying about for eternity.&nbsp; See that you are the clear
turning point, that this message that revolves around the most
obvious of things--that we wouldn't hide from ourselves proof
that we are living in the Matrix; and that no sane person would
simulated earthquakes or disease ... this is how we <i>turn
everything around.</i><br />

<br />
<div align="justify">It doesn't take much to see this is really
what all the fuss is about; it's about seeing that there's some
kind of "battle here" between the idea of a collective
consciousness of the "Majority" causing the news to fail to
Report that there's a very real message encoded in not just 1
Thessalonians 5:2 and in Revelation 1:7 and in "<i>the elements
will melt with fervent heat</i>" all tying to the 9/11 tragedy
and the idea that there's pretty clear evidence there was quite
a bit of foreknowledge of this event not just in Exodus and in
Bush's inaugural address but also in stock market action prior
to the event.&nbsp; We're looking at a hidden conspiracy
attempting to steal the future and freedom from each and every
one of you--here in this place where that starts with hiding the
true nature of our existence and the fact that there's a message
in every word.&nbsp; It's not a theft that's attainable and the
amount of idiocy we see here all around us is without doubt
untenable.&nbsp; Often I've seen remarks like "because 9/11" on
shows like the Simpsons and Family Guy as some kind of
chastisement of this illogical darkness that threatens the
continuation of freedom and individuality; and it's really
surprising to me that Americans are staring at this message
about breaking the chains of slavery through actually seeing
what they are and how they work and<a href="./SECORDANOLIVED.html"> choosing to hide that information
from themselves--and the world</a>. <br />
<br />
The whole point is that it appears that this large conspiracy
includes you, and it appears that you think you are "in control"
and even worse than that it appears you don't see how silencing
your beliefs and your response--as well as the continuation of
slavery and of earthquakes like the Fukushima disaster and the
continuation of the simulation of oil scarcity and land scarcity
doesn't clue you in to the idea that "the Pan" you're believing
yourself to be in control of is on simmer and waiting for you to
stand up and shout that you too don't think we should be
simulating pain or disease.&nbsp; It's a big deal, you know;
because we&nbsp; are doing those things right now, and there's
no doubt from the message of "<i>force majeure</i>" that it's an
act of God that has shown us very clearly these things were
create by an act of nature, and perpetuated by the majority's
failure to want to discuss this message and this world changing
truth in public.&nbsp; There's really no doubt about it, I'm
screaming to a million people directly, and probably indirectly
to billions and billions of souls that we need to stand up and
take action right this very moment--that we stand at the point
in time where Zion and El Dorado and Jerusalem and Atlantis
really are all coalescing around this momentous and hallowed
idea that we should be seeing a city rising from the sea and
floating into the sky (painted there indelibly), thanks--San
Lucas--for that idea... one which will inevitably lead us to a
place where we <a href="./ADAMSROD.html
">have permanent
Doors to the Rooms of Heaven</a> be as commonplace and part of
our society as airplanes (really buses or Uber, I think) are
today.<br />

<br />
<div align="justify">I really don't think it's as obvious as it
should be that <i>it's really not you</i> causing "the Silence"
and it's really not in your best interest, or in the best
interest of what is actually causing it--though when all is said
and won it will probably be clear that the entirety of Creation
has benefited from the "wall" (see "w/ all") turning into the
"way" and causing what will probably look like a very rapid
chain reaction of agreement that many of the changes being
proposed by this message, through our hands and modern art, are
the kind of thing that is really a hands down and easy to make
decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the heart of "ALL SPARKY" and the
idea that Humanity is very clearly the big H of the Horn of
Revelation, being prodded ever so gently by the tiny "n" of
"NORAD is not a question, it's a map of shining through time"
... that this idea that woven into our everything is a clear
plan of how to proceed swiftly and methodically changing the
most basic rules of our reality in order to more closely match
our societies morals and standards.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It's probably not very clear that what today looks like a vast
conspiracy of a huge number of us to "stonewall progress" is
without doubt a sort of designed <i>frame job</i>--<a href="./2017-08-03-yesterda.html
">the heart of Yesterday</a>
and a license plate I saw in Orange County that read "YESSHHHUA"
... which implies that "yes, you are a" with the new religious
understanding that that specific letter ties to the pan of Peter
Pan's gate and also to the EWok of San Lucas and the "OVEN" of
this particular ant pointing out the covenant here is keeping us
from getting what we really want and deserve--and there's no way
it's actually you.&nbsp; In the meantime, it's very obvious that
it, the contents of the pan voting for Silence and no discussion
came from a time very much like ours, and people that might have
once been almost exactly like you--but they're certainly not
here walking around on the ground afraid of stray bullets or
falling balloons full of TNT.&nbsp; They're not being plagued by
the weaponization of incarceration and poorly conceived
solutions to a code of law that has become unweildly and
completely out of date in the wake of a message suggesting that
we can and should see the child shooters as victims just like
the children shot--here in this place where it's clear that
schizophrenia and many other disorders of thought are also a
weaponized attack on our world--ultimately designed to ensure
that you act swiftly and appropriately to see that the same
technology being used to deliver this message through our hands
can also completely eliminate "crazy" as well as "ignorant" and
also those of you plagued with "DOWN Syndrome" over the fact
that you still haven't figured out you need to stand up and
speak (perhaps shout) to change the world.<br />

You've now been armed with a weapon of statistical proof that
shines bright for all eyes to see that we are Created and that
we are living in the Matrix and that the point of the Matrix is
to overcome the idea that "force majeure" is anything but proof
that even if you aren't "in the voting collective called a" you
are still here standing on the ground in the place where we
should see very clearly that it's not the NRA that needs to go
away, but rather the actual bullets; in this place where the Ku
forming in the Heavens begins with your call to alter the
fundamental rules of our false reality and turn "simulated
reality" into "Heaven."&nbsp; The problem here is that in the
dark we appear to be fighting against Constitutional Rights like
the right to bear arms in what is perhaps the false belief that
a "well regulated militia" will bring about a change in
government--where the real truth is that the actual weapon that
brings about this Revolution throughout the Heavens is a working
news infrastructure; newspapers and television media are the
tools that will help us to quickly recognize the import of this
message, and move swiftly to overcome the idea that a "Majority"
belief in silence and darkness and lack of actual truth and
recognition of the change wrought by this message being
unsealed--the idea that majority has anything to do with popular
opinion the moment we see "Minority Report" intersecting with
Neo's magically falling bullets... is actually possible <i>and
happening</i> in the world today.<br />
<br />
Until you stand up and call a reporter, you really are the
silent majority fighting with all your apathy and all your lack
of action against the "iacta" heart of "the dye is cast" ... and
do understand it is this dye that really does cause Heaven to
form of our world--with our hands, the builders of a better
place, for <i><a href="./gate.reallyhim.com">you and for me</a>...

and the entire human race.<br />
<br />
You have the distinct opportunity to turn this "debacle" into
the event that provides safety and communication and
transportation to the entirety of our civilization--something
we should be very excited about beginning, also ensuring that
we too are never again plagued by possession, planetary
simulated jails; and who knows what else goes on in the
crevices of whatever people here believe is up in the
sky--hiding its existence and it's goings on from the world
here--this place that should and will be acting as a check on
morality throughout the future.<br />

<div align="justify">So you have a very clear message connecting
the book of Names to HIV and AIDS and to bands from the Cure to
21 Pilots to KISS ... and a kiss of love that brings Superman's
S to the meaning Judas and Midas ... and the idea that we're not
killing a myth--we are actualizing the hopes and the dreams of
everyone who has spent any time at all thinking about how and
why Jesus Christ turned stone to bread ... to Guitar Man and
Going the Distance and Gene Roddenberry.&nbsp; We are reforming
the idea of Heaven, and clearly seeing the guidance of the ages
coming to us from OS X and Windows XP--more kisses for the idea
that we really don't need to put much thought into the
confluence of Seagate and Margate, FL and Watergate to
understand that we have a message here about freedom, free
thought and free speech and actually "voting" and caring about
the world--joined with a clear Gate of Truth, one that links to
the ideas of hard drives and cities and hotels--and puts Zion
and Atlantis in superposition in the skies of my dreams--the
Holy action that catalyzes Doors to that place, to the ballroom
that Taylor and Jim keep singing about--where I'm sure they'll
get to <i>shake hands</i> :).&nbsp;&nbsp; The overriding point
is that the signs are very clear and very prevalent and the
thing with the brightest glowing light being shone on it is "the
writing is on the wall" that the censorship and the lack of love
for democracy and participating in the deliverance of this
message is the thing standing between us and walking to a
floating island in the sky--and through that act ensuring that
disease and pain and infirmity are forever banished from the
skies above... and every single rock in the Dryad Pirate's

<div align="justify">I've got to admit, I was a little sheepish at
first, when I noticed it was the key to "(Peter) Pan says: <i>do

Ra</i>" and that particular "box" that I've now connected to "<i>kiss</i>,
owe B" and Paradox--which probably suggests that in the past
iterations of this time we've had a similar failure to "<a href="./dox.reallyhim.com">DOX me</a>" which is internet slang
for "call a reporter" ... I noticed it in the key placement of
the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount--which connects to a
hidden history of the revolutions of the Rock of Ages and the
re-creations of Heaven--at which we appear to be the final
round.&nbsp; It's in "Pose... I do N" that connects Poseidon and
NORAD to Parker Posey and Taylor's words "start the car and take
[us] home" that you might also liken to "what I'd really like,
dad, is to borrow the car keys" and the road to Heaven that
shows through a series of "Ro" words that mean "heart of" that
this path and this plan is without doubt the Heart of A.D. ...
the purpose of our timeline and of my delivering the key to the
message, and the car; of uh, Icarus and Wayward Son--directly to
this call to see "What would Jesus do?" is clearly sing about
Bread and Cake and Doors to Heaven.&nbsp; Clearly, he's
suggesting you sing--you know, like a canary and call a
reporter.<br />

Seeing the evolution of El Dorado ... and reading for the first
time "do our AD... <i>oh</i>" in that Golden City destined to
be in the sky; that and "oh gee," it's even the new name for the
Pantheon of Egypt suggesting both the city and the most high
Gods are all feeling a little sorry for my complete lack of a
sex life for the last few years as I've now connected this
particular dream to the one Daniel decoded ... relating this
very <i>seven year period</i> to the Biblical drought in the
Nile--something it brings color to my cheeks and tears to my
eyes to think might finally be coming to an end--and result in a
sort of flood for those of you "calling me on my cell
phone."&nbsp; I don't fault Drake for mocking me a little, or
for loving his bed more than Adam<font color="#cccccc">'s</font>
shoes--but I think the real treasure moment will be seeing me
roll over with embarrassment and blushing ... hopefully on
Connie Chung or whoever does the real important TV interviews
these days... over just how little I would have made this
completely illogical 'ban on flirting with me' a central focus
of a message showing us how silly and slave like our entire
society has become in the wake of what appears to actually be a
ban on 'recognizing the truth' and correctly analyzing language
and history.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So... as Nike reminds us... IT is proof, and you apparently
really needed a little more proof and a "nudge" to get you to
care enough to pick up the telephone.&nbsp; Also, I'm sure it
will lead to lots of laughs; and sex.<br />

<div align="justify">Hey there Suez; and hello Canal City; see I
can show you this message is etched all over the map; connecting
China and Washington and Wyoming and Hey Zeus to the Hebrew name
of God ... that's El Elyon.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sws3MZJIv9c&amp;list=PLgYKDBgxsoMM0iittdDlREVqTc4wn7ylK">The.. the...</a> began Taylor's
"hey Adam" at the age of six; and tied forever Dr. Who and the
Seuss Who's to the name of the planet in Hebrew (which is
Adamah) and the U.S. Army cry of "who-ah?" ... and <a href="./SECORDANOLIVED.html">it's the
"YO N" that (literally) defines Ever<b>yon</b>e</a>; in this
infinite loop (to be broken here) that shows Stallone's (stall
on...") Yo Adria and 2C-YON ... of Judge Dred; linking this very
message of ... if you don't wake up and begin speaking about "HI
EL" etched in Achilles story and in Paris's name; then we're
destined to come back once again to this place where we've
defined everyone as being carbon copies of the last time <i>nothing

good happened</i> when we were faced with a disclosure that
could instantly end disease and slavery and ... and use it to
free the entirety of Creation from the idea that we're all one
mind.&nbsp; Something I've unfortunately began to see very
clearly emanating from the zombie like <a href="./horn.s.lamc.la">statements

of Persephone</a>--per say, cell phones for the powers in the
Heavenly places that would have you all say nothing, or
worse--tell me to "just shut up" that nobody cares about the
simulation of ... Hell; or the fact that there's a very clear
and poignant message explaining why it is we need to begin
talking about it in order to separate ourselves from the chains
of Revelation 20:1 and the idea that we really are just like the
last time "everyone decided" that the truth had no place being
discussed in the world that was responsible for ensuring it
reaches the far ends of Creation.<br />

This message is actionable right now--you don't need a
statistical analysis to tell you there's Heaven pouring out of
everything we do, and everything we see--you don't need a
mathematician to tell you to care about stopping the simulation
of disease and pain--you know right from wrong, you know you
should be picking up the phone and calling <i>someone</i> to
see why this message that has touched a huge number of
newspapers and TV stations and universities and world
governments ... not to mention churches and temples around the
globe (and the unholy game of telephone some of you are "per-se-playing")--to see why it is that this thing isn't properly being
covered on television--where you know it should be--and where it
would actually help us to reform the Heavens and guide our
future to someplace bright and shiny rather than the dark world
of lies and secrets that must be behind ... well, still not
seeing it on the news.<br />
