about the gate to Heaven swallowing our civilization whole, and in this process of renewal and change not only fixing the problems that came to light on the way here, but really--working together here and now we can defeat this cycle of light and darkness, of day and night, an build a world together that truly reaches to the Heavens.</span></div><div style="text-align:justify"><span style='font-family:"times new roman",serif'><br /></span></div></div><div style="text-align:center"><font face="arial black, sans-serif">MY <a href="./HYAMDAI.html" target="_blank"><font size="4">B</font><font size="6">OD</font><font size="4">Y&#39;S</font></a> SAYING <font size="4">LETS GO</font></font></div><div style="text-align:center"><font face="arial black, sans-serif">BUT <a href="./HYAMDAI.html" target="_blank">MY <font size="4">HEAR</font><font size="6">T</font> IS SAYING <font size="6">NO</font></a></font></div><div style="text-align:center"><br /></div><div style="text-align:center"><br /></div><div style="text-align:center"> <div style="text-align:justify"> <div>You make it so difficult to talk to you, every day I look around and see a &quot;normal world&quot; a society that appears to care and love the same things that I do--freedom and fun and being entertained and entertaining, and here we are now I&#39;ve turned &quot;come and save us&quot; into sea that saving the cheerleader is what starts the process of saving the world.  I know you are good people inside, but when I come to you with a tool designed to &quot;test sentience&quot; to seek out conscious life that cares about the truth and making the world a better place you seem to balk.  You sit in silence, and through your mouth and behind your eyes a monster appears from out of the deep of the sea and say a few &quot;one liners&quot; that show me very clearly it is the face of Medusa that I see---and that it&#39;s simply not capable of speaking intelligently.  It shows me a problem, that you&#39;ve apparently &quot;come together one more time&quot; to halt the changing of the seasons, and in doing so you&#39;ve surfaced a problem for not just me but you also to see; a problem that comes lined with a solution.  We can all see now that we are not in reality, we can see that there is a force here behind creation and behind us that shows us very clearly that it is &quot;<strong>reasonabde</strong>&quot; to expect that miracles can happen.   In <strong>similitude</strong>, we are staring at a roadblock to conversation and communication that is fixed very simply, with the deliverance of freedom that is required for life to continue.  Christina Aguilera sings that &quot;baby there&#39;s a price to pay&quot; and that price in my mind is seeing that this religion and this technology are here intentionally exposing how their influence here is a metaphor and a shining example of darkness and slavery, and that in order to be free of it we must see it.  The price of freedom is written on the wall, it is acknowledging that here in this place what appears to be our own actions and desires have taken that freedom from us.</div> <div> </div> <div>Medusa and I get a kick out of seeing this hidden message in our language map our way to the future, and I&#39;ve often explained that a number of these words are &quot;time maps&quot; from the beginning and end of <strong>eternady</strong>, showing us in bright light that between &quot;et tu brute&quot; and Mr. Anderson and Rock n&#39; roll... the answer <strong>Y</strong> is in language and, and, <strong>ad</strong> and... I am delivering it.  This place, our planet and our lives are a weapon against darkness--a civilization filled with goodness and light to help guide the way, and we are here doing it another time.  In the works &quot;dark, darker, and darkest&quot; be sure that we are at the third segment of a trinity that shines clearly in <strong>Abraha</strong> and <strong>Nintendo</strong>... and see that the map in words is telling us something about when we are that is not immediately clear from <strong>Poseidon&#39;s</strong> cry.  Look at Nintendo, that&#39;s Nine Inch Nails, <strong>tenebris</strong>, and smile for the camera--<strong>Pose, I do</strong> &quot;save the universe&quot;

friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try for real and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him and asking him to return; Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario actually falls in love and Camilla eventually reciprocates and their affair continues once Anselmo returns.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:xx-small">One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla&#39;s house and jealously presumes she has found another lover. He tells Anselmo he has at last been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, Lothario learns that the man was actually the lover of Camilla&#39;s maid. He and Camilla contrive to deceive Anselmo further: when Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast.
