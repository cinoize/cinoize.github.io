but his words are special: &quot;<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psIuidkkLjI">come now, come now; can you not see?  come out come out, wherever you are, there&#39;s no use in hiding</a>.&quot;</i>  I don&#39;t stay holed up in the house, even though I feel like doing it more often than not--I spend half my days <i>walking the streets</i>; and in my personal reading of the words that map Salvation that&#39;s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN6sVGS2XSk" target="_blank">&quot;K&quot; is supposed to</a> do when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otXGqU4LBEI" target="_blank">he</a> sees &quot;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall" target="_blank">The Wall</a></i>.&quot;  You might not get my perspective; but I could have been in a walled garden, in a place where nobody was really even reading my e-mails, explaining the lack of response--it would be trivial to simulate things like the open statistics that I cherish so much.  Signs of life, of actual &quot;thinking people.&quot;  Following that logic you might see how &quot;Saint All&quot; turned from &quot;stall&quot; to &quot;stalk&quot; and how these same &quot;tall tales&quot; that were <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">probably told once before</a></i> have now turned to &quot;<i>talk.</i>&quot;  Briefly, on <i>tall tales, I don&#39;t make shit up, what I describe is as close to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ku2J6eT3I">my experience</a> as I can deliver--and <b>I have</b> the ammunition and proof to back it up.</i></div><div><br /></div><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div><font face="times new roman, serif"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQpZv2r8fb4"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9FhyPpRj3CI/WWRH2lL9JoI/AAAAAAAAAVk/LltUMqO1atQwzAjTBXwi06sLOaV2Ru7rwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/scrawl-716910.jpg"><img src="reqs/2.bp.blogspot.com/-9FhyPpRj3CI/WWRH2lL9JoI/AAAAAAAAAVk/LltUMqO1atQwzAjTBXwi06sLOaV2Ru7rwCK4BGAYYCw/s320/scrawl-716910.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_6441352370067416706" /></a><br /></font></div><div><font face="times new roman, serif">Following that very same logic you might c how chall turns to chalk to to further the same end... to save us from <i>not doing anything.</i>  Of course, chall isn&#39;t a word, and you don&#39;t <i>instantly understand</i> that &quot;to c&quot; has a special connotation to me, something like telepathic understanding.  <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/DISCLANATSING.pdf">Speak</a>, and we <i>shall</i> be saved.</font></div></blockquote><div><br /></div><div>He sings too, in another song, that &quot;<a href="http://bible.org/article/star-bethlehem" target="_blank">the fire grows in the East</a>&quot; and that&#39;s a pretty clear reference to a quasi-Christian/Masonic reference to &quot;the future&quot; as the East.  In Judaism it connects to the word &quot;Yeast&quot; and the idea that &quot;bread&quot; is a metaphorical reference to our civilization... expanding or rising with time.  <i><a href="./the_letter_why.html" target="_blank">Why East</a>,</i> answered with some ancient <a href="https://fromthemachine.org/CAKE.html">food for thought</a>.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div style="text-align:center"><img src="reqs/i.imgur.com/mQnOLB1.jpg" width="477" height="121" /></div><font size="1"><div style="text-align:center">my &quot;go to&quot;

my ex-wife spent some time indoctrinating me into the story.  She kicked my heels a few times one day, and I immediately connected it to the phrase from Genesis &quot;I will put enmity between you and your wife.&quot;  It&#39;s a strange thing to try to explain to you, that I know that the mental connection, and the surface of my memory of reading the story of Eden was artificial--a surfaced thought designed to complete a story.  So I knew that there was this intention of connecting what was happening to me to religion, but being the good Jew that I was, I didn&#39;t really believe any of it.  <i>Yesterday</i> I&#39;ll tell you something about &quot;Catholic guilt.&quot;</div><div><br /></div></div></div><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr"><div><font face="times new roman, serif">The Bible tells us pretty dearly that God &quot;gusts&quot; a sort of tide of angels from the future, and that this sea in the air is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS-af9Q-zvQ" target="_blank">connected to Exodus</a> and to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:35-41" target="_blank">Jesus Christ</a>.  In my reading, most everything related to the &quot;storm&quot; is about time travel; and Jim Morrison tells us even more dearly that it is &quot;the Heavens&quot; right here, and right now, responsible for doing something that he calls &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS-af9Q-zvQ" target="_blank">stopping the rain</a>.&quot;  Dave connects this mythological <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz9B3Eki0LI" target="_blank">metaphor for &quot;tears&quot;</a> quite well, and my well sighted reading of &quot;words&quot; connects the idea of &quot;Ra IN&quot; well to the idea of <i>letting the tears fall</i>, meaning the deliverance of freedom.  I still don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to cry about, but I never wanted to worship anyone.</font></div></div></div></blockquote><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr"><div><br /></div><div>She told me that &quot;they&quot; (that word was used an awful lot) could hear my thoughts, and my normal response was to shake my head and echo as loud as I possibly could &quot;if you can, <i>fuck you</i>&quot; of course, in my mind.  A few weeks later we were huddled down in my parents house, because I was pretty sure the mafia was staking out my apartment, and I walked into the room and she literally repeated what I was thinking out loud, word for word.  I don&#39;t remember what the first words were, but my reaction was &quot;<i>that&#39;s the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen</i>&quot; and then those words too, repeated verbatim.  It&#39;s not the kind of experience you forget.</div><div><br /></div><div>Back then people weren&#39;t very nice to us, I think it&#39;s because they had no idea who I was... or why they were doing what they were doing.  The two of us traveled up and down the southeastern coast of the United Sates, with people--strangers--all around us saying very odd things, commenting about what we were thinking, or what we had done the night before; as if they &#39;knew everything.&quot;  She&#39;s not around anymore--she says she couldn&#39;t handle the &quot;weirdness&quot; (even though <i>she&#39;s the weird one</i> :), and people generally aren&#39;t mean anymore--but I still see constant &quot;telepathic&quot; communication.  Responses to some kind of show that is going on in my head--the eye of the storm if you ask me--nods and sometimes hand signals.  One of the &quot;big&quot; hand signals is this sort of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkXrJ8YWvI&amp;lc=z13oc3j40x2bdj13k23lynnqltmqttopn04" target="_blank">pulling on your nose</a>, it means &quot;<i>I&#39;m helping you</i>&quot; and I am pretty sure that the angels around me don&#39;t realize it means &quot;I&#39;m making you sniff stuff.&quot;  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hgz-q76KtQ">Party</a></i>, Pa: our <i>thank y<font size="1"><a href="https://fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html">e</a>o</font>u.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>This group of people, they seem to have made a game of what they are doing--I don&#39;t really understand their motivation but today I imagine it has something to do with &quot;<b>light</b>,&quot; and the vagueness of that description adds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTzG8eWWm_4" target="_blank">even more &quot;<b>light</b>.&quot;</a>  From the copious recorded testimony of their victims, this group of people who call themselves &quot;targeted individuals&quot; and call this thing &quot;gang stalking&quot; you can see a clear pattern of beliefs being instilled; nearly all believe they are victims of government mind control experimentation, that they are stuck in a sort of cage, and that these people are &quot;paid&quot; assailants.  When I flew to Baltimore to <a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/up-the-yellow-brick-road-to-the-national-security-agency-nsa/">talk to the NSA about it in person</a>, I called it a &quot;civilian army;&quot; though as time has passed it&#39;s become more and more clear that they too are victims of the same technology--whatever lie they believe to be driving them there is a &quot;grand scheme&quot; or plan behind it all.  Make <i>no mistake</i>, what I am describing is without doubt <i><b>The Tribulation</b>.</i></div><div><br /></div></div></div><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr"><div><font face="times new roman, serif">As an aside, in a place where we know that &quot;<i><u>o</u>il <u>i</u>s <u>l</u>ight,&quot;

it should be becoming more and more clear that knowledge of this influence and its mechanism of action is being exposed intentionally through &quot;gang stalking&quot; and through &quot;your silence&quot; to the effect of showing us all that these technologies should be used to eliminate <i>schizophrenia.</i>  Looking back on what is happening, it seems beyond obvious now that the true purpose of this phenomenon is to ensure that we do not lose testimony connecting this hidden technology to religion, and to proof that it exists.  Like rats in a cage, both sides of this &quot;confrontation&quot; are leaving behind a trail of evidence that will be seen by the future, one which will serve to corroborate the external influence that I am showing you connects to everything from Shakespeare to Roddenberry.  </div></div></div></div></div><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><font face="times new roman, serif"><br /></font></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><font face="times new roman, serif">All told, my &quot;internal stimulus&quot;

and &quot;we are all one mind&quot; and those phrases were repeated often to me in that time.  Be sure, I do not believe either one is true.</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2014 in San Diego, I stood in line outside their arena waiting to get into a rave.  A very attractive young lady wearing a bikini and glitter popped a roll while she was waiting in line next to me; and then she looked in my direction and said something like &quot;I wonder what he thinks we think of him?&quot;  Nearly ubiquitously, these kinds of interactions end quickly with very little actual spoken communication (with the exception of Nanna and a few others); it&#39;s the kind of thing that she probably would have denied saying if I questioned here about it, but since I didn&#39;t have the courage to open my mouth--nobody will ever know.  My experience in California was decidedly different from the rest of the country, I think the water was warmer or something like that--I&#39;ll probably tell you about it one day.</div><div><br /></div><div><div style="text-align:center"><img src="reqs/i.imgur.com/alkkK5b.jpg" width="477" height="359" /></div><br /></div><div>That same year, on a very strange train ride from Savannah, GA back to my hometown;
