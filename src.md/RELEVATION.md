<p><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</p>

<p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px;">I&#39;m telling you--this world wants me to hate it vehemently--and I do.&nbsp; I want change, and I want it now.&nbsp; I much prefer &quot;he&#39;s happy, he&#39;s happy&quot; to &quot;uhhh huh.&quot;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px;">-RBZ&nbsp; ... by your lack of response.</span></strong></p>

<p>You know, just as soon as you stop hating &quot;me&quot; and &quot;this.&quot;&nbsp; it&#39;s simple words ... we have tacit, tangible, and obvious proof that the entirety of our history is basically here to remind us not to mis-use technology ... not to hate, not to lose ... &quot;everything&quot; and still that&#39;s what it seems we are doing.</p>

<p>&quot;You people&quot; seem hyper-focused on my &quot;facade&quot; rather than the proof and the message all around us; the mess, the sickness, the natural disasters that we certainly should see are &quot;stiooppable&quot; at :&quot;majority force&quot; and just a minority of people actually speaking out.&nbsp; I really don&#39;t mean &quot;you&quot; but rather literally everyone around me--get out of my head, forget about trying to get rid of me ... forget about me needing to be &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;up to some standard&quot; I am what I am, and I am not embarrassed--or wrong.&nbsp;</p>
