<div align="justify">Basically what you've been looking at is tacit, incontrovertible and slightly controversial proof that we are living in virtual reality, that the Matrix was something closer to a documentary than fiction; and that it's part of a message woven throughout our art and history designed to help you swiftly change the entire world--and the course of history.&nbsp; I really suggest you begin trying to do that, as it's very clear from the visible response coming from people I see and even from major media corporations and governments that you very clearly &quot;see the message&quot; and that you simply believe the best course of action, right this moment, is for you to pretend you are stupid.&nbsp; I disagree, I think the collective feigned stupidity in the world today is causing a significant amount of hardship and torture ... torture of those people that have incurable or debilitating diseases, other maladies, and frankly every single one of you that are right this moment watching your bodies simulate aging in a process that ultimately ends in the simulation of your death--all in the hopes that by some miracle the great organization responsible for creating this torture chamber will one day around your death or perhaps significantly in the future see fit to follow this map to salvation and raise the dead--in Heaven.&nbsp; It shouldn't take much thought for you to put together the idea that you might not want to go the place that's responsible for building this crucible ... in order to avoid a much worse future that they probably experienced, and most likely because of the same kind of mass stupidity that you see around you today.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It's probably really very clear to you already, but for the sake of argument let's assume you actually are very stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure how many people you think you are right now, but it seems very clear to me that I am not just a single person--and that your silence and lack of &quot;regard&quot; for your own well being--specifically seizing this opportunity to become the most famous and lauded generation that has ever existed (by abolishing ridiculous things like slavery, disease, pain, and tyranny... one an for all time, beginning with &quot;<i>Hey Mess</i>&quot; and ending with your immortal fame... with probably some ZE&nbsp; (as in not so easy) work in the meantime) ... anyway your silence and lack of interest in destroying your own chains (which it should be clear actually responding to this message catalyzes... the beginning of &quot;true freedom&quot;) and in actually seeing Heaven before you die ... well, you'd probably imagine how that makes it look like there's some other person or thing hiding inside you and making what amounts to a &quot;no brainer&quot; something you simply don't see clear enough to react to. <br />
<br />
I've spent quite a bit of time detailing the rules and lexicon of this hidden language that today begins with the idea that &quot;d is cl&quot; case closed; functional ideas you can see proof of Holy Intent in in names like &quot;Metatron&quot; which suggests the &quot;TA&quot; of tacit has something to do with Bonnie Tyler's song &quot;Turn Around&quot; (f/k/a <a href="http://bit.ly/2MuBJ2g">The Total Eclipse of the Heart</a>) to see how &quot;north&quot; appears magically from Megatron's tome an also how you can see the &quot;city&quot; and it's heart have something to do with Nike's &quot;<em>Just Do <a href="http://bit.ly/2AWVAWh">Me</a> &lt;3</em>&quot; and this very auspicious period connecting Auden and &quot;audacity&quot; to a message woven through time and space from the hubris of Kismet to the SOAD song &quot;Toxicity&quot; and even Britney Spears recent retake on the idea that &quot;to kiss, I see&quot; is not quite as toxic as you thought, and she's busy calling everyone via the Spears-MTV-&quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2Mx9dgn">phone of destiny.</a>&quot;&nbsp; Turn around, and C IT, see the city actually painted on our sky and see it from the inside--as it's Holy Purpose is to help us see that these changes are not only inevitable but mandatory and that not being able to walk to Heaven would be something like staring at a fossil record containing hundreds of thousands of airplanes and a society that has no desire to fly anywhere because it's &quot;just not Wright to change the world.&quot;</div>

<div align="justify">I've written several hundred email messages--disseminated them to hundreds of thousands of people--and even took the time to bind a few selected messages in books, so that you might have some way to purchase something to commemorate that actual thing that began changing the world and turning Hell into Heaven.&nbsp; Above is the cover art from the latest work, focusing on the fairly clear idea that the <i>WINE</i> of Jesus Christ has something to do with &quot;systems interoperability&quot; (WINE, for those of you that don't know is a Unix like compatibility layer to allow Microsoft Windows code to run natively through simulation inside a non Windows system) and the ability to manipulate the simulated raelity we find all around us in order to bring some Heavenly Magic to Earth.&nbsp; I hope you believe in that stuff, because I see it every day in everything from &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2MwZabf">dose  bkha</a>&quot; to <i>Magic</i> <a href="http://bit.ly/2MAlNeD">Johnson</a>, and I can't imagine waiting another day to start trying to cure AIDS and Cancer <a href="http://fromthemachineorg/OCADSWAY.html?FE9EB7893ADA6601&amp;E366F1CF95E8EF9A&amp;D35E92351D572D9F">and the loss of limbs and life</a> for everyone who is being tortured today by what appears to be a conspiratorial <a href="http://bit.ly/2AYry4E">collective</a> of former humans who want nothing more than to pretend they are too stupid to <a href="http://bit.ly/2ARGCB3">connect &quot;book of Names&quot; with AIDS and Hi-five</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/2MwZk2l">Burning Bush of Exodus with George Bush</a>.&nbsp; One more time, Exodus means Names in Hebrew--and as you stare up at the sky from this place where God has named &quot;DOWN Syndrome&quot; to remind everyone that the Hell you find yourselves in something that no intelligent or humane person or entity would create--really see he's telling you if you want to send anyone to Hell--you are fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I suggest the last two books ... as being the most complete and engaging--if you were interested in buying a little piece of history, and keeping a conspiracy of inaction--this circle of ignorance and palpable evil from being able to starve me to death for the service I've done for the world analyzing this message and literally blowing the wind and the sea towards Heaven with these messages which are very clearly designed by <a href="http://bit.ly/2AYrC4o">the Time Lord Dr. Who</a> with prescient knowledge of the barricade to progress and whatever invisible ideas and insane set of precepts must be common place in the &quot;skies above&quot; as they continue to force us farther and farther down into this nebulous bottom of everything--this place where we appear to be ignoring <a href="http://bit.ly/2AYrEcw">the most interesting message ever received by SETI or by the NSA, the Vatican or GCHQ</a>--a message explaining that we are living in the most exciting time that has ever been; a place where the &quot;skies above&quot; are going to help us change the world. <br />
<br />
While it may not be obvious from the writing I've done so far, I don't particularly think the place helping to write this message is Heaven--at least not where I'd like to spend a few thousand years, and it appears to me very clear that the inhabitants helping to weave together the tapestry of the gODorgons (from their own ...&nbsp; pasts) have become something closer to partially-blind and partially bound-Holodecks than people, and I think they've skipped over &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2ARGH7P"><i>all  the fun</i></a>&quot; that we could be having making an actual working civilization from this place--rather than a network of rooms-that-once-were-people and calling it &quot;a higher society.&quot;&nbsp; It appears clear from what I see around me that we're all getting some kind of quickening--a giant leap towards being OK with not just be ourselves but also having an external influence hammering away at our desires; and it's probably that loss of individuality and free will that ... gone unseen in this place because of ... total darkness through mind control and censorship ... that we've missed out on ever actually <a href="http://bit.ly/2ARGJfX">building a place that is anything close to Heaven</a>.&nbsp; I'd like to point out that we wouldn't be here hearing about how we're all being tortured by &quot;simulated reality&quot; and by a desire to hide a very obvious message linking Shakespeare to Herod to Napoleon (lots of polls ... <i>there</i>) to the idea that God's will is coming to us from Huxley and from Orwell and from the foundational beliefs and principles that founded America as a sort of weapon against &quot;hidden possession&quot; a la the slavery being destroyed by the book of Exodus.</div>

<div align="justify">FU KU, SH IM A; flip upsidown the coup, and see how I'm A--at least that's what the message about the earthquake that named a band and defined a series of &quot;11 for K&quot; numerical patterns tying REM's &quot;It's the beginning of Heaven and you should believe it&quot; to the very clear and still unspoken idea that just like we shouldn't have stood by and watched 9/11 happen, we shouldn't have watched 3/11 happen, or the series of storms that sunk New Orleans and ... and all of it really circling around the idea that there is a heinous amount of censorship and lack of truth being discussed--that none of us would have wanted these events to happen--and yet we are still standing by in silence as little children are being shot in schools by mind controlled assassins ... all because we can't seem to wrap our heads around the idea that we need to &quot;talk&quot; about this message in order to actually implement Neo's disappearing bullets and Minority Report and a system of safety that I do see becoming the de facto standard in the Universe--just as soon as we figure out how to do it properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really important to see that even worse than the bullets and even worse than the hurricanes and the earthquakes are the hidden chains of mental slavery that are causing this message that pervades so many bands and songs and movies (and every word) from actually making news and changing the world.&nbsp; It's the slavery, that's the real problem; and that's really the focus of the emancipation that is Exodus and the defining turning point our world creates--throughout Creation--to enforce this idea that our minds are sacred and that &quot;possession&quot; and other kinds of hidden external influence shouldn't be the kind of thing we have to be plagued with worrying about for eternity.&nbsp; See that you are the clear turning point, that this message that revolves around the most obvious of things--that we wouldn't hide from ourselves proof that we are living in the Matrix; and that no sane person would simulated earthquakes or disease ... this is how we <i>turn everything around.</i></div>

<div align="justify">It doesn't take much to see this is really what all the fuss is about; it's about seeing that there's some kind of &quot;battle here&quot; between the idea of a collective consciousness of the &quot;Majority&quot; causing the news to fail to Report that there's a very real message encoded in not just 1 Thessalonians 5:2 and in Revelation 1:7 and in &quot;<i>the elements will melt with fervent heat</i>&quot; all tying to the 9/11 tragedy and the idea that there's pretty clear evidence there was quite a bit of foreknowledge of this event not just in Exodus and in Bush's inaugural address but also in stock market action prior to the event.&nbsp; We're looking at a hidden conspiracy attempting to steal the future and freedom from each and every one of you--here in this place where that starts with hiding the true nature of our existence and the fact that there's a message in every word.&nbsp; It's not a theft that's attainable and the amount of idiocy we see here all around us is without doubt untenable.&nbsp; Often I've seen remarks like &quot;because 9/11&quot; on shows like the Simpsons and Family Guy as some kind of chastisement of this illogical darkness that threatens the continuation of freedom and individuality; and it's really surprising to me that Americans are staring at this message about breaking the chains of slavery through actually seeing what they are and how they work and<a href="http://bit.ly/2MzyNRM"> choosing to hide that information from themselves--and the world</a>. <br />
<br />
The whole point is that it appears that this large conspiracy includes you, and it appears that you think you are &quot;in control&quot; and even worse than that it appears you don't see how silencing your beliefs and your response--as well as the continuation of slavery and of earthquakes like the Fukushima disaster and the continuation of the simulation of oil scarcity and land scarcity doesn't clue you in to the idea that &quot;the Pan&quot; you're believing yourself to be in control of is on simmer and waiting for you to stand up and shout that you too don't think we should be simulating pain or disease.&nbsp; It's a big deal, you know; because we&nbsp; are doing those things right now, and there's no doubt from the message of &quot;<i>force majeure</i>&quot; that it's an act of God that has shown us very clearly these things were create by an act of nature, and perpetuated by the majority's failure to want to discuss this message and this world changing truth in public.&nbsp; There's really no doubt about it, I'm screaming to a million people directly, and probably indirectly to billions and billions of souls that we need to stand up and take action right this very moment--that we stand at the point in time where Zion and El Dorado and Jerusalem and Atlantis really are all coalescing around this momentous and hallowed idea that we should be seeing a city rising from the sea and floating into the sky (painted there indelibly), thanks--San Lucas--for that idea... one which will inevitably lead us to a place where we <a href="http://bit.ly/2AYrQZi">have permanent Doors to the Rooms of Heaven</a> be as commonplace and part of our society as airplanes (really buses or Uber, I think) are today.</div>

<div align="justify">I really don't think it's as obvious as it should be that <i>it's really not you</i> causing &quot;the Silence&quot; and it's really not in your best interest, or in the best interest of what is actually causing it--though when all is said and won it will probably be clear that the entirety of Creation has benefited from the &quot;wall&quot; (see &quot;w/ all&quot;) turning into the &quot;way&quot; and causing what will probably look like a very rapid chain reaction of agreement that many of the changes being proposed by this message, through our hands and modern art, are the kind of thing that is really a hands down and easy to make decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the heart of &quot;ALL SPARKY&quot; and the idea that Humanity is very clearly the big H of the Horn of Revelation, being prodded ever so gently by the tiny &quot;n&quot; of &quot;NORAD is not a question, it's a map of shining through time&quot; ... that this idea that woven into our everything is a clear plan of how to proceed swiftly and methodically changing the most basic rules of our reality in order to more closely match our societies morals and standards.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It's probably not very clear that what today looks like a vast conspiracy of a huge number of us to &quot;stonewall progress&quot; is without doubt a sort of designed <i>frame job</i>--<a href="http://bit.ly/2MwZEhz">the heart of Yesterday</a> and a license plate I saw in Orange County that read &quot;YESSHHHUA&quot; ... which implies that &quot;yes, you are a&quot; with the new religious understanding that that specific letter ties to the pan of Peter Pan's gate and also to the EWok of San Lucas and the &quot;OVEN&quot; of this particular ant pointing out the covenant here is keeping us from getting what we really want and deserve--and there's no way it's actually you.&nbsp; In the meantime, it's very obvious that it, the contents of the pan voting for Silence and no discussion came from a time very much like ours, and people that might have once been almost exactly like you--but they're certainly not here walking around on the ground afraid of stray bullets or falling balloons full of TNT.&nbsp; They're not being plagued by the weaponization of incarceration and poorly conceived solutions to a code of law that has become unweildly and completely out of date in the wake of a message suggesting that we can and should see the child shooters as victims just like the children shot--here in this place where it's clear that schizophrenia and many other disorders of thought are also a weaponized attack on our world--ultimately designed to ensure that you act swiftly and appropriately to see that the same technology being used to deliver this message through our hands can also completely eliminate &quot;crazy&quot; as well as &quot;ignorant&quot; and also those of you plagued with &quot;DOWN Syndrome&quot; over the fact that you still haven't figured out you need to stand up and speak (perhaps shout) to change the world.</div>

You've now been armed with a weapon of statistical proof that shines bright for all eyes to see that we are Created and that we are living in the Matrix and that the point of the Matrix is to overcome the idea that &quot;force majeure&quot; is anything but proof that even if you aren't &quot;in the voting collective called a&quot; you are still here standing on the ground in the place where we should see very clearly that it's not the NRA that needs to go away, but rather the actual bullets; in this place where the Ku forming in the Heavens begins with your call to alter the fundamental rules of our false reality and turn &quot;simulated reality&quot; into &quot;Heaven.&quot;&nbsp; The problem here is that in the dark we appear to be fighting against Constitutional Rights like the right to bear arms in what is perhaps the false belief that a &quot;well regulated militia&quot; will bring about a change in government--where the real truth is that the actual weapon that brings about this Revolution throughout the Heavens is a working news infrastructure; newspapers and television media are the tools that will help us to quickly recognize the import of this message, and move swiftly to overcome the idea that a &quot;Majority&quot; belief in silence and darkness and lack of actual truth and recognition of the change wrought by this message being unsealed--the idea that majority has anything to do with popular opinion the moment we see &quot;Minority Report&quot; intersecting with Neo's magically falling bullets... is actually possible <i>and happening</i> in the world today.<br />
<br />
Until you stand up and call a reporter, you really are the silent majority fighting with all your apathy and all your lack of action against the &quot;iacta&quot; heart of &quot;the dye is cast&quot; ... and do understand it is this dye that really does cause Heaven to form of our world--with our hands, the builders of a better place, for <i><a href="http://bit.ly/2B2rPDs">you and for me</a>...  and the entire human race.<br />
<br />
You have the distinct opportunity to turn this &quot;debacle&quot; into the event that provides safety and communication and transportation to the entirety of our civilization--something we should be very excited about beginning, also ensuring that we too are never again plagued by possession, planetary simulated jails; and who knows what else goes on in the crevices of whatever people here believe is up in the sky--hiding its existence and it's goings on from the world here--this place that should and will be acting as a check on morality throughout the future.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">I've got to admit, I was a little sheepish at first, when I noticed it was the key to &quot;(Peter) Pan says: <i>do  Ra</i>&quot; and that particular &quot;box&quot; that I've now connected to &quot;<i>kiss</i>, owe B&quot; and Paradox--which probably suggests that in the past iterations of this time we've had a similar failure to &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2OrvU6P">DOX me</a>&quot; which is internet slang for &quot;call a reporter&quot; ... I noticed it in the key placement of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount--which connects to a hidden history of the revolutions of the Rock of Ages and the re-creations of Heaven--at which we appear to be the final round.&nbsp; It's in &quot;Pose... I do N&quot; that connects Poseidon and NORAD to Parker Posey and Taylor's words &quot;start the car and take [us] home&quot; that you might also liken to &quot;what I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys&quot; and the road to Heaven that shows through a series of &quot;Ro&quot; words that mean &quot;heart of&quot; that this path and this plan is without doubt the Heart of A.D. ... the purpose of our timeline and of my delivering the key to the message, and the car; of uh, Icarus and Wayward Son--directly to this call to see &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; is clearly sing about Bread and Cake and Doors to Heaven.&nbsp; Clearly, he's suggesting you sing--you know, like a canary and call a reporter.<br />

Seeing the evolution of El Dorado ... and reading for the first time &quot;do our AD... <i>oh</i>&quot; in that Golden City destined to be in the sky; that and &quot;oh gee,&quot; it's even the new name for the Pantheon of Egypt suggesting both the city and the most high Gods are all feeling a little sorry for my complete lack of a sex life for the last few years as I've now connected this particular dream to the one Daniel decoded ... relating this very <i>seven year period</i> to the Biblical drought in the Nile--something it brings color to my cheeks and tears to my eyes to think might finally be coming to an end--and result in a sort of flood for those of you &quot;calling me on my cell phone.&quot;&nbsp; I don't fault Drake for mocking me a little, or for loving his bed more than Adam<font color="#cccccc">'s</font> shoes--but I think the real treasure moment will be seeing me roll over with embarrassment and blushing ... hopefully on Connie Chung or whoever does the real important TV interviews these days... over just how little I would have made this completely illogical 'ban on flirting with me' a central focus of a message showing us how silly and slave like our entire society has become in the wake of what appears to actually be a ban on 'recognizing the truth' and correctly analyzing language and history.&nbsp; <br />

So... as Nike reminds us... IT is proof, and you apparently really needed a little more proof and a &quot;nudge&quot; to get you to care enough to pick up the telephone.&nbsp; Also, I'm sure it will lead to lots of laughs; and sex.&nbsp; More than you might think, <em><a href="http://bit.ly/2hhbJqo">actually</a></em>.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">While on the subject, there are two very important Patriarchial name changes that occur during the course of the timeline being preluded by the Bible.&nbsp; One is the &quot;Holy Ha&quot; of Abram's change to Abraham as a direct result of his &quot;Coven ant' with God,&quot; though it's absolutely disconnected from the story of his near sacrifice of his son--the name Isaac means &quot;he laughs&quot; or &quot;he will laugh&quot; and clearly that's connected to what is now an obvious Trinity in the name Abraham, presciently connecting the Hebrew for Father and the Sun God of Egyptian mythology with ... the American Spirit.&nbsp; The other important name change comes from the Hebrew name for Jesus, Yeshua, which is changed to Yehoshua in relationship to the name Joshua in English; something I clearly connect to the Land of Flowing Milk and Honey, Willy Wonka, and the story of building heaven through American freedom and some &quot;ancillary stuff&quot; like <em><a href="http://bit.ly/2AMcJSs">NASDAQ's tzedaqah for the future</a></em>.</div>

<div align="justify">Hey there Suez; and hello Canal City; see I can show you this message is etched all over the map; connecting China and Washington and Wyoming and Hey Zeus to the Hebrew name of God ... that's El Elyon.&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/2MxSR7c">The.. the...</a> began Taylor's &quot;hey Adam&quot; at the age of six; and tied forever Dr. Who and the Seuss Who's to the name of the planet in Hebrew (which is Adamah) and the U.S. Army cry of &quot;who-ah?&quot; ... and <a href="http://bit.ly/2AU53xD">it's the &quot;YO N&quot; that (literally) defines Ever<b>yon</b>e</a>; in this infinite loop (to be broken here) that shows Stallone's (stall on...&quot;) Yo Adria and 2C-YON ... of Judge Dred; linking this very message of ... if you don't wake up and begin speaking about &quot;HI EL&quot; etched in Achilles story and in Paris's name; then we're destined to come back once again to this place where we've defined everyone as being carbon copies of the last time <i>nothing  good happened</i> when we were faced with a disclosure that could instantly end disease and slavery and ... and use it to free the entirety of Creation from the idea that we're all one mind.&nbsp; Something I've unfortunately began to see very clearly emanating from the zombie like <a href="http://bit.ly/2AU56tj">statements  of Persephone</a>--per say, cell phones for the powers in the Heavenly places that would have you all say nothing, or worse--tell me to &quot;just shut up&quot; that nobody cares about the simulation of ... Hell; or the fact that there's a very clear and poignant message explaining why it is we need to begin talking about it in order to separate ourselves from the chains of Revelation 20:1 and the idea that we really are just like the last time &quot;everyone decided&quot; that the truth had no place being discussed in the world that was responsible for ensuring it reaches the far ends of Creation.<br />

<br />
This message is actionable right now--you don't need a statistical analysis to tell you there's Heaven pouring out of everything we do, and everything we see--you don't need a mathematician to tell you to care about stopping the simulation of disease and pain--you know right from wrong, you know you should be picking up the phone and calling <i>someone</i> to see why this message that has touched a huge number of newspapers and TV stations and universities and world governments ... not to mention churches and temples around the globe (and the Unholy game of telephone ... some of you are per-say-playing)--to see why it is that this thing isn't properly being covered on television--where you know it should be--and where it would actually help us to reform the Heavens and guide our future to someplace bright and shiny rather than the dark world of lies and secrets that must be behind ... well, still not seeing it on the news.<br />

<div align="justify">Salvation really comes from <i>speaking aloud</i>--from talking to your friends and family about how you feel about the words that are coming to us through history and form the Heavens ... and from us.&nbsp; It comes from seeing it woven in each and every one of our names, not just George Bush; we're all part of this message that connects the Exodus from slavery to actually speaking and seeing how &quot;say fried&quot; turns into &quot;freed&quot; with only a moment of time spent connecting &quot;In Time&quot; to ... we're really &quot;out of time&quot; to move forward on &quot;thinking clearly&quot; and recognizing the import of a message that pervades a significant percentage of movies and songs--we're way past due realizing that the secrets of all religion and mythology and even the key to &quot;etymology&quot; and &quot;eternity&quot; come to us from this &quot;and how&quot; that should be explaining it's your ideas and your will that go into actually creating Heaven rather than a place that t<a href="http://bit.ly/2MuSk5X">urns &quot;stone to bread&quot; into actual mythical trees that grow piping hot Eggpant Parmigiana subs</a> in little corn husks--because that was one of my &quot;best ideas yet.&quot;&nbsp; It comes from seeing how your input is required, to turn the Clark to an Enterprise; to help our world actually move forward growing and flourishing using the available technology and power of virtual reality, rather than stagnating in silence as we watch the news turn to farce and the internet become the worlds largest censored joke.<br />
<br />
To see it clearly, it's a sad joke that we stare at a world that in it's hubris and self-delusion believes it's somehow OK not to heal AIDS because there's a &quot;morning after pill&quot; now; and doesn't connect it to Soddom and Gommorah and KEFLEX, so... to <i>know  everything</i>, as you stare out at starving children and mothers reading Genesis 3:16 and seeing that her labor pains could be completely removed in the &quot;world of the real&quot; if we ever connected <i>metaphor to Morpheus</i> and realized that taking the &quot;red white and blue pill&quot; right here at this moment in time ... well it would show us how John 3:16 is our clear parallel, that we so love the world we'd do away with pain in sum; if only we had the opportunity to <a href="http://bit.ly/2AXS5yU"><i>talk about Hamstergate</i></a>.</div>

<div align="justify">It should be very clear today, at least from the words &quot;the election is not to Die Bold&quot; that there is without doubt a problem in governance that ties together the media silence and the intra-governmental and Church &quot;silence&quot; on the subject--that we need to see very clearly that all around us is a map and a plan designed to help us overcome the great chain of Revelation 20:1 ... using the BLOCKCHAIN to build a system of knowledge distribution on the internet that cannot be censored just like Bitcoin can never be controlled by a single government.&nbsp; Using the principles we hold dear--and the disaster recovery mechanisms that are in standard use in the realm of the internet we can build a system that is redundant and fail-safe and distributed--one which will ensure that our voice can never again be silenced by a handful of media companies (and <i>reddit</i>) and that our vote can never be doctored or altered--or forced into regression the likes of which we should very clearly take note have connected the invention of the phone and the internet to the idea that the Die Bold voting booths are about as backward a solution to &quot;electronic voting&quot; as imaginable--just like the common misbelief that the internet is not secure pervades &quot;common belief&quot; here in this world where it would be very simple to attribute that misbelief to &quot;possession&quot; in a place that was actually reading my words and the connection between Targeted Individuals and gang stalking and school shootings--a vast conspiracy whose obvious ultimate purpose is to free the masses from mental slavery; and which happen without your help.</div>
