   The thing I am doing here, is called &quot;trying to save the Universe,&quot; I could use
   <strong>
    your help.
   </strong>
   :)&nbsp; I believe that through this message, which shows the purpose of religion and &quot;Creation&quot; is to deliver knowledge and proof of the existence of technologies previously hidden... things like time travel and mind control; technologies that are clearly described and archived in the annals of religion under the &quot;guise&quot; of prophesy and divine inspiration. &nbsp;Through this message, we see very clearly that much of our modern technology, from the laws of physics in Trinity College ... Adam's ... I mean, Isaac's Apple and computing ... all tie directly to this message of a plan coming to us &quot;from above.&quot; &nbsp;That plan begins to take shape when we see that the mechanism of delivery here is designed to help us regain freedom and an understanding of ... well, the stuff of Heaven... which we are about to build, once again. &nbsp; I hope you will take the time to read some or most of this message, and see if you think it's what you are looking for--I think it will be.
  </p>
  <p>
   This message was widely distributed &nbsp;around Christmas, and while I imagine you may or may not have heard about it, I doubt very much that you are aware of the details without seeing them, and I do think you will like what is being presented more than you might have thought... judging by the fact I don't really see anyone seeking it out. &nbsp;I do think quite a bit of the early stages here are focused on a renewal of American liberties... and here specifically on destroying the kind of censorship we might have once associated with Nazi Germany, but are actually seeing evidence of here directly because of this event. &nbsp;Please understand, this is all about building Heaven, and making sure our liberty is actually achieved is a good corner stone, I think.

    &nbsp;I know Christmas is coming, believe me... I know.&nbsp; I should probably have some great happy thing to share with you--we're going to have to settle on both proof of Creation and Heaven. &nbsp;At home her, things are not great right now, I think our world is plagued by a number of problems that aren't really our fault--and yet here we are not doing very much to make it better. &nbsp; I know these problems come from our future--or the one that didn't have them here, and instead wound up making it themselves; here we are in a place learning about secret and&nbsp;

      A great many of the patterns I have presented also imply ... actually show the design of our world's intent to build Heaven.&nbsp; The religious themes of video game consoles and computer companies--from the SEGA Genesis to Bill Gates, as a Gateway to Eden's Apple ... these things show a clear and obvious link between computers and Heaven.&nbsp; To me it's a clear statement that the promises of the Bible are bieng fulfilled, we can see it happening all around us--now right now--is the time to start participating more... and to understand that Heaven is much more than bricks and mortar--it's not&nbsp;

      <em>
       everything
      </em>
      &nbsp;we have an opportunity to turn around a number of social and systemic patterns that would otherwise lead us towards a Hellish future.&nbsp; Nearly all of these problems revolve around the secrecy or misuse of technology, and this theme points me to the Constitution which has been changed a number of times improving social equality--but not once during the largest technological singuarlity in all of the history of the Unvierse... through the advent of phones, computers, and the internet... we have not properly addressed issues like privacy and public disclosure over and over.&nbsp; It is the kind of thing that you could almost be sure is designed.

      Seeing that design and rebounding from it with grace is the goal today.&nbsp; Honestly on top of that never seeing anything &quot;designed wrong on purpose&quot; ever again should be another high priority.&nbsp; Our voting process is obvious &quot;silly,&quot; twice now we have seen the outcome of an election fail the popular vote--and we aren't really talking about doing anything about that.&nbsp; That's a real problem, don't you think?&nbsp; A huge underlying theme of the &quot;Light of the Burning Bush&quot; is a focus on using computers to aid in creating a true democracy--not a &quot;representative one&quot; which you might remember Bush speaking about in the aftermath of 9/11.&nbsp; It's always been obvious to me that this was an &quot;inevitability&quot; a world where the people act as the legislative branch does today--truly designing their own laws; the&nbsp;

      &nbsp;pronounciation of the &quot;ineffable name&quot; often rendered as Yahweh. That too is easy to deduce from the Egyptian God &quot;Yahu&quot; but our scholars haven't tried to solve it, really. It ties to the name of Jesus,&nbsp;

       Yeshua--Yes, who-ah?&nbsp;

      Which of course is all about the American GI cry that Al Pacino and Denzel Washington immortalized on the silver screen. The point? The planet is Adamah in Hebrew.&nbsp; Understand the implications, one that there's serious blindness being exposed related to religion--as a tool to show us that it's not limited to just that (
      <i>
       look science and computering everywhere in religion, who knew?

     The clear pattern here is seeing everything is wrong, on purpose--with a glowing chance for real purpose on the horizon.&nbsp; It's a pattern that is by design, I can assure you--I've heard His voice with my own ears explaining to me what he called something like &quot;the teachers methods.&quot; &nbsp;As you may or may not be aware, I've had a problem with speed, with trying to help us jump closer to Heaven just as fast as I can.&nbsp; God's &quot;solution&quot; to this was to make that problem worse, artificially, and until very recently make it impossible to break the habbit.&nbsp; He told me as much, in clear words--something I am trying to do for the world at the macrocosmic level where we see the same thing happening all the way back with the British East India Tea Company to the CIA in Los Angeles in the 1980's, and just a year ago with China, the United States Post Office and a good sized fraction of urban America.&nbsp; This... this is his &quot;

     I want to remid you again of how quickly our society has changed in these last few years--a little more than a decade and text messages and instant messaging on the internet have gone from a thing &quot;of living in your mothers basement and fishing computer parts out of the trash&quot; to ... every single one of your kids&nbsp;

      needing it
     </i>
     &nbsp;every day, if not you too.&nbsp; With that in mind, Amazon's Echo and Alexa, Apple's Iris, and Google's &quot;OK&quot; are already showing us that we don't even want to type our questions into our phones or tablets--we need to have interactive voice response--answers on demand all the time. &nbsp;

    <div>
     &nbsp;

     <i>
      decidendly wrong.
     </i>
     &nbsp; For instance, in Minority Report punishing people as if a crime was committed doesn't help anyone--just like our prison system; A Scanner Darkly shows us exactly who should&nbsp;

      not be anoyzmied--the watchers rather than the innocent; I think you and many others around me are a good example of why &quot;thinking you know everything&quot; or have some secret and magical way to know what something says without reading it... is probably a mechanism of slavery rather than true.

     I can tell you I never saw them in th world all around me, each and every day, unitl they were pointed out to me--and then I was somewhere&nbsp;

     , certainly it piqued my interest in a message that otherwise--well, that I was already interested in.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that once they are pointed out, if you do not think that it's a significant event--if you don't see&nbsp;

     Speaking from a posiiton of experience, actually having something similar to Neo's magical learning mechanism, I can tell you that it is not all it's cracked up to be.&nbsp; That being said, just like our world and the problems illustrated in Dick's work I wouldn't go without them completely, I want to make them better.&nbsp; It's feedback, cahasing dreams, and true serendipity that we have a golden opportunity to see things that were once hidden, to decide together what we think about them, and to move forward. &nbsp;
