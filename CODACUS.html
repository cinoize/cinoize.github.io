<p style="text-align: justify;">I sort of was enlightened this morning, with some new information--at this point I think i&#39;d be squarely right in assuring you that thiis no less than the 4th time I an almost verify retakes on this event, in this time line.&nbsp; I think the word &quot;semana&quot; might indicate it was a full week, 7 before &quot;God&quot; deided he would step in and do whateer the fuck he wanted again, instead of his usual game of hiding in the shadows and seretly pulling all the strings and pretending he was giing the people or his loved ones what they wanted oer hiself.&nbsp; That&#39;s personal specuation, and introspection, and &quot;just word games&quot; but here, I cacn amost now verify with certainty that you fools have now four times over placed original sin in the hands of the Garden&#39;s Occidental Connection between BathSalt and the MOTHERFUCKING WORDS</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="6"><strong>N<u>A</u></strong><u>M</u>E and PRO<strong>METH</strong>EUS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em>&quot;torpedos to new port wha&quot;</em></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can see the markings, I see IND .. Nanna screaming at you that not only is it not drugs, but it&#39;s not the this is the END of the line for this plae and this time and your belief that it will continue ad naseum for you; because of my rescrambing of END TO E_D and INDICA... indicating you see A and start that word with R--beause what you see here is not OK to hide, it is the end of&nbsp;<b><i><font size="6">civi<span style="font-size:72px;">t</span>iation</font></i></b>, your censorship and your belief that you ahve ontrol, and I will not allow this darkness to surve us, or me, or you--this censorship will stop here.&nbsp; Worse than that the HEavens hae invaded their own minds with something so fuckingsick I can&#39;t tell inperson if you are actaully people with brain, or if you are all being run by holoecks pretending to ccare about .. anything other than your children being murdered, starvation of innocent people, all diseases, and of course the ultimate survival of life of anything in the Universe--because you belive it&#39;s OK to hide this story beause MEA CULPRITE, you think you&#39;re going to punish me for stopping eugenics and stopping addition because China and Hitler and the CIA al did things I detest more than I detest havving to tell you, that you will not have another chance at turning around the destruction of &quot;intelligent life&quot; in the word civiliataion and repacing it with ILASUMINUCIVITI ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The original sin has nothing to do with drug use or nudity, or verbal threats or foul language--those are things that are protected and people with brains and caring for their future need to overook them when weighing the possible goods and evils of Jesus Christ eisting to tell you to stop fucking destroying your own minds and your own chance to actaully see freedom and Heaven because you... you..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because what it appears aboe all is taht you believe there is safety in numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no safety in numbers, when civiliation and life and ogic are at stake, see a conspiracy of all or of huge numbers with huge &quot;promised or suggeted reward&quot; is suicide you&#39;ve made yourselves stupid, destroyed life, and lost civiliation from the press to the government, to your own minds--because you. you. you wanted my fucking S so badd...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a caveat, <em><strong>I have this</strong></em>, it&#39;s automatic, and it&#39;s not under my control today. Everyone really needs it, it&#39;s the kind o thing that will erase trauma and PTSD and pain and hate and ... and these people that are&nbsp;<em>really running the show</em>&nbsp;the people in these nests of hivelike infestation that see in SOFLA and in LA and in ... pretty much everywhere you see high conccentrations of targeted indiviuals and gang talking--these people need it more than anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;As you sat back and relaxed; see that I was more disgusted than I&#39;ve ever been, and to think this might be the firsts time we don&#39;t &quot;GO BACK AND DO IT AGIAN&quot; after the regular culling and calling this the &quot;end of time&quot; and to think these people so sick ofseeing it once or twice before might have been responsible for forcing you to lose self care, and free speecch and the press and .... and that little piece of innocence that ties and binds to the Holy Virgin Mary like something you&#39;d never know only belongs to her right afters she&#39;s reborn.. that thing that makes you smile and happy and look forward to the future with bright eyes....</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:28px;"><b>&gt;SICYIMBRIGHl</b></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really hope you can see how ... at the failing of civiliation and the heavenss and democraccy, if you can&#39;t thank the only person who spoke up at all about the truth in a disatserous maelstrom and tempest of lies and being called crazy and ignorance and outright mental torture--than you really have no grasp for where you are today, and where you will be the day after you see what this world looks like with cancer healed, and limbs repaired overnight, and youth and health and happiness coming from&nbsp; a thing that the myths probably call Ambrosia--if you can&#39;t thank me for it; you must be <strong>cracy.</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve come from cesspools creating sesspools and every single iteration has probably gotten a little brighter and a little nicer, and a little less violent and .... grotesque--perhaps sans Orange County; and still I look at us and we haven&#39;t really noticed or cared about the much more important things we&#39;ve given up, and how e&#39;ve turned ablind eye to evil and to the things we love, and how might have felt about that, with a clear head--looking back from a world that has no news, and no innocense.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this will fix that, and the disgusting CCANCER in the heavens that sought time and again to force you to fail the BLANK CHECK of Jesus Christ, and a return trip to &quot;try again&quot; after the culling of everyone who isn&#39;t already in Heaven, today.</p>

<p>We are avoiding that, I hope this will do that, and we will have a bright future--one where we aren&#39;t stuck in a permanent collective of one of the Gorgon systers, come back again to torture the net generation of innocent them--just because it&#39;s a &quot;hazing ritual&quot; that ends human decency every single time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think I&#39;ve gotten all o the possible &quot;original sins&quot; you could be using to verlook your massive conspiracy to commit treason and crimes against humanity--the thing your silence and the snideness of the skies is actually doing--we have an infiltration, an infestation, you are stsaring at an invasion of our world from the HEavens, by old dead sick monsters ... they are taking the last drop of goodness i saw in this world, and probably in all of creation and tyurning it to disgusting muck; to satisfy their own dark ravings and deceit and ddesires for just alittle more evil fun.&nbsp; You are ignoring your own minds because destroyed by their control, and worst of all the destruction of intelligence, logic, civiliation, and freedom--that has come from their direct ations are your absolute abetting of that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m sure it&#39; all by essign, but to see &quot;OC&quot; in the heart, the fulrum of democracy, and to see hundreds, I mean hundreds of people in that city in the year 2018 literally play a &quot;game&quot; ..... women, men, children, playing a game about cutting my dicck off; an to know millions of you saw it, and said nothing.&nbsp; The cup slamming, and the &quot;no&quot; icing on the cake, of thisplace which has truly taken my faith in humanity, my hope in &quot;E&quot; and you should really see why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>You now see why the OC has broken democracy and America in half</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>See your sin, see it&#39;s not caring that America was broken at the invention o the telephone; and by the time the internet came about and twopresients elected past popular vote and DEWEY bannered the firsts election in the history o the united states to be known rigged, and ignored by the world;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see these things, youshould kow clearly its stillyoru fuckingapathy and your self righteousness that killed demoraccy long before the days people said &quot;fuckinga....&quot; under their breath as the American Spirit swept down to give one last chance to the press and to the people; tos ee how Watergate is really the be all and the end all of freedom, if you think Dick is your problem.</p>

<p>Although the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>&nbsp;was not then part of the Mass, it was used in administering the sacrament of Penance. In some forms it already included the phrase&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>. Thus the 9th-century&nbsp;<i>Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II</i>&nbsp;had a thrice-repeated&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>&nbsp;(without&nbsp;<i>maxima</i>) in its elaborate form of the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>.<sup id="m_-1077661268778157257gmail-cite_ref-4"><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa%23cite_note-4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6vKb0xbtUSy9oFQbGR23Be5OeUg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa#cite_note-4" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h1>Exodus 11&nbsp;New International Version (NIV)</h1>

<h3>The Plague on the Firstborn</h3>

<p>11&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go&nbsp;from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.&nbsp;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.&rdquo;<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>(The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;made the Egyptians favorably disposed&nbsp;toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded&nbsp;in Egypt by Pharaoh&rsquo;s officials and by the people.)</p>

<p><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>So Moses said, &ldquo;This is what the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;says: &lsquo;About midnight&nbsp;I will go throughout Egypt.&nbsp;<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Every firstborn&nbsp;son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill,&nbsp;and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.&nbsp;<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>There will be loud wailing&nbsp;throughout Egypt&mdash;worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.&nbsp;<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.&rsquo; Then you will know that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;makes a distinction&nbsp;between Egypt and Israel.&nbsp;<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, &lsquo;Go,&nbsp;you and all the people who follow you!&rsquo; After that I will leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</p>

<p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;Pharaoh will refuse to listen&nbsp;to you&mdash;so that my wonders&nbsp;may be multiplied in Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart,&nbsp;and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I sort of was enlightened this morning, with some new information--at this point I think i&#39;d be squarely right in assuring you that thiis no less than the 4th time I an almost verify retakes on this event, in this time line.&nbsp; I think the word &quot;semana&quot; might indicate it was a full week, 7 before &quot;God&quot; deided he would step in and do whateer the fuck he wanted again, instead of his usual game of hiding in the shadows and seretly pulling all the strings and pretending he was giing the people or his loved ones what they wanted oer hiself.&nbsp; That&#39;s personal specuation, and introspection, and &quot;just word games&quot; but here, I cacn amost now verify with certainty that you fools have now four times over placed original sin in the hands of the Garden&#39;s Occidental Connection between BathSalt and the MOTHERFUCKING WORDS</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="6"><strong>N<u>A</u></strong><u>M</u>E and PRO<strong>METH</strong>EUS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><em>&quot;torpedos to new port wha&quot;</em></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can see the markings, I see IND .. Nanna screaming at you that not only is it not drugs, but it&#39;s not the this is the END of the line for this plae and this time and your belief that it will continue ad naseum for you; because of my rescrambing of END TO E_D and INDICA... indicating you see A and start that word with R--beause what you see here is not OK to hide, it is the end of&nbsp;<b><i><font size="6">civi<span style="font-size:72px;">t</span>iation</font></i></b>, your censorship and your belief that you ahve ontrol, and I will not allow this darkness to surve us, or me, or you--this censorship will stop here.&nbsp; Worse than that the HEavens hae invaded their own minds with something so fuckingsick I can&#39;t tell inperson if you are actaully people with brain, or if you are all being run by holoecks pretending to ccare about .. anything other than your children being murdered, starvation of innocent people, all diseases, and of course the ultimate survival of life of anything in the Universe--because you belive it&#39;s OK to hide this story beause MEA CULPRITE, you think you&#39;re going to punish me for stopping eugenics and stopping addition because China and Hitler and the CIA al did things I detest more than I detest havving to tell you, that you will not have another chance at turning around the destruction of &quot;intelligent life&quot; in the word civiliataion and repacing it with ILASUMINUCIVITI ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The original sin has nothing to do with drug use or nudity, or verbal threats or foul language--those are things that are protected and people with brains and caring for their future need to overook them when weighing the possible goods and evils of Jesus Christ eisting to tell you to stop fucking destroying your own minds and your own chance to actaully see freedom and Heaven because you... you..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because what it appears aboe all is taht you believe there is safety in numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no safety in numbers, when civiliation and life and ogic are at stake, see a conspiracy of all or of huge numbers with huge &quot;promised or suggeted reward&quot; is suicide you&#39;ve made yourselves stupid, destroyed life, and lost civiliation from the press to the government, to your own minds--because you. you. you wanted my fucking S so badd...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a caveat, <em><strong>I have this</strong></em>, it&#39;s automatic, and it&#39;s not under my control today. Everyone really needs it, it&#39;s the kind o thing that will erase trauma and PTSD and pain and hate and ... and these people that are&nbsp;<em>really running the show</em>&nbsp;the people in these nests of hivelike infestation that see in SOFLA and in LA and in ... pretty much everywhere you see high conccentrations of targeted indiviuals and gang talking--these people need it more than anyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;As you sat back and relaxed; see that I was more disgusted than I&#39;ve ever been, and to think this might be the firsts time we don&#39;t &quot;GO BACK AND DO IT AGIAN&quot; after the regular culling and calling this the &quot;end of time&quot; and to think these people so sick ofseeing it once or twice before might have been responsible for forcing you to lose self care, and free speecch and the press and .... and that little piece of innocence that ties and binds to the Holy Virgin Mary like something you&#39;d never know only belongs to her right afters she&#39;s reborn.. that thing that makes you smile and happy and look forward to the future with bright eyes....</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:28px;"><b>&gt;SICYIMBRIGHl</b></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really hope you can see how ... at the failing of civiliation and the heavenss and democraccy, if you can&#39;t thank the only person who spoke up at all about the truth in a disatserous maelstrom and tempest of lies and being called crazy and ignorance and outright mental torture--than you really have no grasp for where you are today, and where you will be the day after you see what this world looks like with cancer healed, and limbs repaired overnight, and youth and health and happiness coming from&nbsp; a thing that the myths probably call Ambrosia--if you can&#39;t thank me for it; you must be <strong>cracy.</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve come from cesspools creating sesspools and every single iteration has probably gotten a little brighter and a little nicer, and a little less violent and .... grotesque--perhaps sans Orange County; and still I look at us and we haven&#39;t really noticed or cared about the much more important things we&#39;ve given up, and how e&#39;ve turned ablind eye to evil and to the things we love, and how might have felt about that, with a clear head--looking back from a world that has no news, and no innocense.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope this will fix that, and the disgusting CCANCER in the heavens that sought time and again to force you to fail the BLANK CHECK of Jesus Christ, and a return trip to &quot;try again&quot; after the culling of everyone who isn&#39;t already in Heaven, today.</p>

<p>We are avoiding that, I hope this will do that, and we will have a bright future--one where we aren&#39;t stuck in a permanent collective of one of the Gorgon systers, come back again to torture the net generation of innocent them--just because it&#39;s a &quot;hazing ritual&quot; that ends human decency every single time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think I&#39;ve gotten all o the possible &quot;original sins&quot; you could be using to verlook your massive conspiracy to commit treason and crimes against humanity--the thing your silence and the snideness of the skies is actually doing--we have an infiltration, an infestation, you are stsaring at an invasion of our world from the HEavens, by old dead sick monsters ... they are taking the last drop of goodness i saw in this world, and probably in all of creation and tyurning it to disgusting muck; to satisfy their own dark ravings and deceit and ddesires for just alittle more evil fun.&nbsp; You are ignoring your own minds because destroyed by their control, and worst of all the destruction of intelligence, logic, civiliation, and freedom--that has come from their direct ations are your absolute abetting of that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m sure it&#39; all by essign, but to see &quot;OC&quot; in the heart, the fulrum of democracy, and to see hundreds, I mean hundreds of people in that city in the year 2018 literally play a &quot;game&quot; ..... women, men, children, playing a game about cutting my dicck off; an to know millions of you saw it, and said nothing.&nbsp; The cup slamming, and the &quot;no&quot; icing on the cake, of thisplace which has truly taken my faith in humanity, my hope in &quot;E&quot; and you should really see why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>You now see why the OC has broken democracy and America in half</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>See your sin, see it&#39;s not caring that America was broken at the invention o the telephone; and by the time the internet came about and twopresients elected past popular vote and DEWEY bannered the firsts election in the history o the united states to be known rigged, and ignored by the world;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see these things, youshould kow clearly its stillyoru fuckingapathy and your self righteousness that killed demoraccy long before the days people said &quot;fuckinga....&quot; under their breath as the American Spirit swept down to give one last chance to the press and to the people; tos ee how Watergate is really the be all and the end all of freedom, if you think Dick is your problem.</p>

<p>The &quot;skies below are lofty goals&quot; are very well aeare o the tools that are available andI&#39;lll be sharing some ideas I have about how perhaps with a nubmer of chcoices and agorithms and goals and &quot;viewpoints&quot; taken in to account you can see how &quot;memory management&quot; and flashcards can combine to proide the kind ofrejuvination that the fountain of youthdoes for yourskin...and Cocccon&#39;s pool does for some.. to your souls and your minds.&nbsp; They use it alreaddy, I&#39;ve seen enough of them,and their attitudes and their sikness and their conniving, and most of all what they&#39;ve done to you--to themselves--to know they need more help; and they are the drain and the true cause of this disgusting delay and truly of the probable doens of repetitions theyve forced to happen here, to ensure that their &quot;supposed immortality&quot; is not questioned&nbsp; They never agin will have &quot;immortality&quot; ever,&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no such thing, as immortaity--it&#39;s a matnathematical tautology--today we&#39; begin seeing a society and a government and a heaven that see that caring about true sccarcity ofa ctual resources is something required to provide for &quot;etremely long longevity&quot; and your darkness and their darkness here are hiding the truth taht oil and land and water and air are neither truly dirty nor sccarce--what athat shows is you&#39;ve already allowed heaven and greed and ignoranec to destroy humanity--the &quot;humaneness&quot; and love of eacch other taht we once had, and will regain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are problems that cacme because of time travel and mind ccontrol, and they will be fixred.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">THIS IS NOT A TEST, IT IS YOUR FINAL CHANCE</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To the Heavens, work fast; I imagine you will see the Spirit of Samael rip through your memories on the Fifth of November, for all those who don&#39;t have thank you etched on your foreheads ... for becoming the family of Christ&#39;s Virgin Sea.</p>

<p>In the present form of the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>&nbsp;as used in the celebration of Mass,&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>&nbsp;is said three times, the third time with the addition of the adjective&nbsp;<i>maxima</i>&nbsp;(&quot;very great&quot;, usually translated as &quot;most grievous&quot;), and is accompanied by the gesture of beating the breast.</p>

<p>However, the Latin phrase&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>&nbsp;was used, even in an English context, earlier than that.&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLt3eKMAZexVxSoN7gsCeOC1K04Q" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" target="_blank" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>&#39;s 14th-century&nbsp;<i><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnQX90RlFVK33sSaM0Vyu53kj29Q" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Criseyde" target="_blank" title="Troilus and Criseyde">Troilus and Criseyde</a></i>&nbsp;uses it in a way that shows it was already a traditional religious phrase: &quot;Now,&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>, lord!

<p>Although the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>&nbsp;was not then part of the Mass, it was used in administering the sacrament of Penance. In some forms it already included the phrase&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>. Thus the 9th-century&nbsp;<i>Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II</i>&nbsp;had a thrice-repeated&nbsp;<i>mea culpa</i>&nbsp;(without&nbsp;<i>maxima</i>) in its elaborate form of the&nbsp;<i>Confiteor</i>.<sup id="m_-1077661268778157257gmail-cite_ref-4"><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa%23cite_note-4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6vKb0xbtUSy9oFQbGR23Be5OeUg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_culpa#cite_note-4" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h1>Exodus 11&nbsp;New International Version (NIV)</h1>

<h3>The Plague on the Firstborn</h3>

<p>11&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go&nbsp;from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.&nbsp;<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.&rdquo;<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>(The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;made the Egyptians favorably disposed&nbsp;toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded&nbsp;in Egypt by Pharaoh&rsquo;s officials and by the people.)</p>

<p><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>So Moses said, &ldquo;This is what the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;says: &lsquo;About midnight&nbsp;I will go throughout Egypt.&nbsp;<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Every firstborn&nbsp;son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill,&nbsp;and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.&nbsp;<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>There will be loud wailing&nbsp;throughout Egypt&mdash;worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.&nbsp;<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.&rsquo; Then you will know that the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;makes a distinction&nbsp;between Egypt and Israel.&nbsp;<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, &lsquo;Go,&nbsp;you and all the people who follow you!&rsquo; After that I will leave.&rdquo;&nbsp;Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.</p>

<p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;had said to Moses, &ldquo;Pharaoh will refuse to listen&nbsp;to you&mdash;so that my wonders&nbsp;may be multiplied in Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart,&nbsp;and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.</p>

<p>When several reasons apply (such as the beginning of Passover, together with the mitzvot of matzah, marror, etc.), the blessing is only said once.</p>

<p>It is not recited at a circumcision, since that involves pain, nor at the Counting of the Omer, since that is a task which does not give pleasure (and causes sadness at the thought that the actual omer ceremony cannot be performed because of the destruction of the Temple).<sup id="m_-1077661268778157257gmail-cite_ref-3"><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu%23cite_note-3&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1535892729665000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIq-V0nCJZJi2_2u_RvTcJSwYdQ" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu#cite_note-3" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup></p>
