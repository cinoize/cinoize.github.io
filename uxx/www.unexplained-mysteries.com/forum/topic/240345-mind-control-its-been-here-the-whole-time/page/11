            "text": "Let\u0027s take a closer look at this list. Is \"alien mind control\" the only possible answer, or are there more logical and terrestrial explanations? \nThe Dendera Light: Already addressed in earlier posts. Changing the meaning of the inscriptions which accompany the relief to suit your personal agenda, does not actually change anything. This has to be understood from the proper context, and from the perspective of the ancient Egyptians. Anything outside those boundaries removes veracity from the equation. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Exodus: A mytho-historical fable underpinning the ancient Hebrew religion. There\u0027s no evidence this event ever even took place. It\u0027s a matter of religion. Religion began as a means in pre-scientific cultures for man to explain the \"unexplainable.\" All religious traditions have some sort of creation story, and Exodus is one of the prime stories for Judaism. That\u0027s all it is. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander, and his teachers: The Eleusinian Mysteries were simply initiation rites for the cult of Demeter; this tradition was only one among numerous in the Greco-Roman world. It again brings us back to religion, which has nothing to do with visitors from outer space. Religion as a means to control is another matter, as Karl Marx was fond of saying, but that\u0027s quite a different thing from the spin you\u0027re putting on it. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nAlexander the Great was a Macedonian king and warlord. He had a couple of notable tutors, especially Aristotle, but as contemporary writers liked to infer, Alexander was not a shining student. He was obsessed with folding the known world into his own realm through the means of conquest. He was driven by the complicated relationship with his father and by his own profound restlessness, and that\u0027s the gist of it. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Fall of Rome: A complicated subject still explored and debated by scholars, but not exactly mysterious. It involved multiple influences including social decay, intra-political divisions, the splitting of the state into East and West, corruption, the changing of socio-political norms in the Mediterranean world, and the advent of burgeoning and spreading barbarian tribes which could no longer be held back. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Creation of the RC Chruch: Once again we\u0027re back into the realm of religion, which has nothing to do with space visitors. The arrival of the Roman Catholic Church was actually a protracted and complicated social development that took centuries to ferment. From Christianity\u0027s origin as a minor Judaic sect to its official adoption in the Roman empire\u2014these were but the beginnings. In all reality, when discussing the development of Catholicism, one might be more correct to express it as \"creations.\" Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Crusades: A series of wars presented as holy Christian undertakings while in fact part of a broader and complicated European socio-political movement. \"Rescuing\" the Holy Land from its Muslim \"infidels\" put a pretty package around it, as did the announcement that those participating would be absolved of all earthly sins, but I think anyone properly acquainted with the Crusades would know it was more than that. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nSeveral notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge: Too vague to bear comment. Vague pronouncements do not bolster an argument, they weaken it. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule: Also overly vague. The fact is, pretty much all such societies are thinly veiled organizations allowing the privileged to band together and behave like naughty boys. While it\u0027s true that some \"secret societies\" strive to promote the success and advancement of its membership, in actuality these groups have little bearing or influence on wider human societies. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nThe Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler: A very simple matter to understand, when framed by its proper context. Germany was roundly humiliated by its defeat in World War I and the subsequent social and economic proscriptions put upon it by the victorious nations of that war. Hitler was only one of numerous fist-pounding demagogues to have emerged in Germany after World War I. The German populace was ripe for strong and decisive leadership, in the same sort of way that weakened and desperate people seek the comfort and strength of a cult today. Hitler was just barely organized and driven enough to have carried it off and to have emerged as the new tyrant. Nothing to do with alien mind control. \nI\u0027ve been watching this discussion since its start, prometheuslocke, and have made a couple of posts of my own. As with others taking part herein, I am familiar with research protocols and how theories are properly formed and delivered. Not once, prometheuslocke, have I seen you properly defend a single one of your statements, or present adequate evidence on your part for your own cause. Simply listing things is not evidence. All it does is reflect your personal assumptions. Assumptions are not evidentiary, nor will they on their own ever win the day. \nSo I would suggest, if you wish to be taken seriously, return to the list above and present credible, empirical evidence to substantiate your assumptions. You are not all knowing, nor is it ever cognitively sound to try to present yourself as the only person \"in the know,\" so it seems you have your work cut out for you. I don\u0027t mean to be a hard-ass, but you\u0027ve been under such heat from Page 1 of this thread because you simply have not presented any convincing evidence. We cannot and will not just take your word for it. \n"

It is actually, the entire point of my book. \nJust to throw something out there, most of them have something to do with hallucinations, drug induced, or otherwise.  At least five of them. \nEdit: here\u0027s something about Hitler\u0027s auditory hallucinations, and his belief in an external force with the ability to... alter history: http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-hidden-hand.html \nHe spoke about a \"dark force\" often. In fact, many of our world leaders have... here\u0027s a few quotes: \n\u201cThere is a power so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that prudent men better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it\u201d \nWoodrow T. Wilson \n\"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence \u2014 on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.\" \nJohn F. Kennedy \n\"I occasionally think, how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask is not an alien force already among us?\" \nRonald Reagan \n"

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Q.1. From all the posts in this thread i have read so far, i dont see any mention of XENO. how come? </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Q.2. "since before Egypt". but i dont see any posts with proper evidence supporting the existence of Mind Control from the Ancient times.</strong></span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> How come?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Q.3 . combining both the above questions - i dont see any relevant material in your posts substantiating the existence of aliens in the ancient times controlling the minds of humanity. how come?</strong></span></span></p>

<p>You haven't looked closely enough.  Granted the forum is somewhat difficult to navigate when you have nearly twenty pages to go through, but the answers to your questions are there.</p>
<p>Things I think "alien mind control" had a huge hand in:</p>
<p>The Dendera Light</p>
<p>The Exodus</p>
<p>The Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander,and his teachers.</p>
<p>The Fall of Rome</p>
<p>The Creation of the RC Chruch</p>
<p>The Crusades</p>
<p>Several notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge</p>
<p>The creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler</p>
<p>After the crusades it became much harder to trace.   I have some theories as to why, the most prominent that our written record was no longer malleable, and it would have been much harder to hide evidence of its existence.</p>

<p>I already did. My mind functions independently. I can think whatever I want. Nothing is stopping or controlling my mind other than me.</p>
<p>I can't evaluate the mental abilities for all of society. You can't either.</p>

<p>What you are saying is you have no reason.  "I have no evidence" and "you think for yourself" are not reasons that you could not be controlled by an external influence.  The simple fact that you really have no reason not to believe me, but yet you vehemently disagree, is proof to me that your beliefs are being altered.</p>
<p>I'm sure you will disagree.  Let's stop discussing it</p>

<p>Also I would like to point out that the title of the book "Nineteen Eighty-Four" (which is the correct title and not "1984") has actually not been changed three times, from 1980, to 1982, to 1984. That's an unproven theory by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Pimlott" rel="external nofollow">Ben Pimlott</a>, which you'll only find specifically in the introduction to the Penguin Books Modern Classics edition of "<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>". Pimlott was a good historian but sometimes a bit controversial with his statements. This happens to be one of them, as far as I know it was never conclusively proven. However, "<em>The Last Man in Europe</em>" was one of the original titles for the novel, but in a letter dated 22 October 1948 to his publisher Fredric Warburg, Orwell wrote about hesitating between the former and "<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four"</em>.</p>
<p>-snip-</p>

<p>You haven't looked closely enough.  Granted the forum is somewhat difficult to navigate when you have nearly twenty pages to go through, but the answers to your questions are there.</p>
<p>Things I think "alien mind control" had a huge hand in:</p>
<p>The Dendera Light</p>
<p>The Exodus</p>
<p>The Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander,and his teachers.</p>
<p>The Fall of Rome</p>
<p>The Creation of the RC Chruch</p>
<p>The Crusades</p>
<p>Several notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge</p>
<p>The creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler</p>
<p>After the crusades it became much harder to trace.   I have some theories as to why, the most prominent that our written record was no longer malleable, and it would have been much harder to hide evidence of its existence.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Why should i go dig up evidence to connect all that you have listed as being evidence of mind control? you are stating that the listed events are by mind control and related to aliens. so the responsibility of proving what you claim soley rests with you.</p>
<p>Why cant you provide concrete evidence that the above listed are indeed connected to mind control. and where are the aliens in the above?</p>
<p>As far as i know, there is mention of aliens or anything Xeno related in any data related to the stuff listed above.</p>
<p>care to provide evidence as asked for?</p>
<p>PS : For your kind information, i have been on this forum for quite long and know how to navigate it quite better than you.</p>

<p>You haven't looked closely enough.  Granted the forum is somewhat difficult to navigate when you have nearly twenty pages to go through, but the answers to your questions are there.</p>
<p>Things I think "alien mind control" had a huge hand in:</p>
<p>The Dendera Light</p>
<p>The Exodus</p>
<p>The Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander,and his teachers.</p>
<p>The Fall of Rome</p>
<p>The Creation of the RC Chruch</p>
<p>The Crusades</p>
<p>Several notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge</p>
<p>The creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler</p>
<p>After the crusades it became much harder to trace.   I have some theories as to why, the most prominent that our written record was no longer malleable, and it would have been much harder to hide evidence of its existence.</p>

<p>I think the alien mind control also had a hand in:</p>
<p>All in the Family</p>
<p>The Archie Bunker Show</p>
<p>Archie's Place</p>
<p>The Jeffersons</p>
<p>Good Times</p>
<p>Maude</p>
<p>Sanford and Son</p>
<p>One Day at a Time</p>
<p>Fernwood Tonight</p>
<p>America 2 Nite</p>
<p>The Facts of Life</p>
<p>Whose The Boss?</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>Wait, no. That's Norman Lear. Not alien mind control.</p>
<p>...unless Norman Lear is using mind control to popularize his TV shows! Of course! Feel free to work this into your nutzy conspiracy theory. I promise I won't take credit for it later on, unless there's money to be made from the History Channel doco that will inenvitably be produced.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at this list. Is "alien mind control" the only possible answer, or are there more logical and terrestrial explanations?</p>
<p><strong>The Dendera Light:</strong> Already addressed in earlier posts. Changing the meaning of the inscriptions which accompany the relief to suit your personal agenda, does not actually change anything. This has to be understood from the proper context, and from the perspective of the ancient Egyptians. Anything outside those boundaries removes veracity from the equation. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Exodus: </strong>A mytho-historical fable underpinning the ancient Hebrew religion. There's no evidence this event ever even took place. It's a matter of religion. Religion began as a means in pre-scientific cultures for man to explain the "unexplainable." All religious traditions have some sort of creation story, and Exodus is one of the prime stories for Judaism. That's all it is. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander, and his teachers:</strong> The Eleusinian Mysteries were simply initiation rites for the cult of Demeter; this tradition was only one among numerous in the Greco-Roman world. It again brings us back to religion, which has nothing to do with visitors from outer space. Religion as a means to control is another matter, as Karl Marx was fond of saying, but that's quite a different thing from the spin you're putting on it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great was a Macedonian king and warlord. He had a couple of notable tutors, especially Aristotle, but as contemporary writers liked to infer, Alexander was not a shining student. He was obsessed with folding the known world into his own realm through the means of conquest. He was driven by the complicated relationship with his father and by his own profound restlessness, and that's the gist of it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Fall of Rome:</strong> A complicated subject still explored and debated by scholars, but not exactly mysterious. It involved multiple influences including social decay, intra-political divisions, the splitting of the state into East and West, corruption, the changing of socio-political norms in the Mediterranean world, and the advent of burgeoning and spreading barbarian tribes which could no longer be held back. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Creation of the RC Chruch:</strong> Once again we're back into the realm of religion, which has nothing to do with space visitors. The arrival of the Roman Catholic Church was actually a protracted and complicated social development that took centuries to ferment. From Christianity's origin as a minor Judaic sect to its official adoption in the Roman empire—these were but the beginnings. In all reality, when discussing the development of Catholicism, one might be more correct to express it as "creation<strong><em>s</em></strong>." Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Crusades:</strong> A series of wars presented as holy Christian undertakings while in fact part of a broader and complicated European socio-political movement. "Rescuing" the Holy Land from its Muslim "infidels" put a pretty package around it, as did the announcement that those participating would be absolved of all earthly sins, but I think anyone properly acquainted with the Crusades would know it was more than that. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>Several notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge:</strong> Too vague to bear comment. Vague pronouncements do not bolster an argument, they weaken it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule:</strong> Also overly vague. The fact is, pretty much all such societies are thinly veiled organizations allowing the privileged to band together and behave like naughty boys. While it's true that some "secret societies" strive to promote the success and advancement of its membership, in actuality these groups have little bearing or influence on wider human societies. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler:</strong> A very simple matter to understand, when framed by its proper context. Germany was roundly humiliated by its defeat in World War I and the subsequent social and economic proscriptions put upon it by the victorious nations of that war. Hitler was only one of numerous fist-pounding demagogues to have emerged in Germany after World War I. The German populace was ripe for strong and decisive leadership, in the same sort of way that weakened and desperate people seek the comfort and strength of a cult today. Hitler was just barely organized and driven enough to have carried it off and to have emerged as the new tyrant. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p>I've been watching this discussion since its start, prometheuslocke, and have made a couple of posts of my own. As with others taking part herein, I am familiar with research protocols and how theories are properly formed and delivered. Not once, prometheuslocke, have I seen you properly defend a single one of your statements, or present adequate evidence on your part for your own cause. Simply listing things is not evidence. All it does is reflect your personal assumptions. Assumptions are not evidentiary, nor will they on their own ever win the day.</p>
<p>So I would suggest, if you wish to be taken seriously, return to the list above and present credible, empirical evidence to substantiate your assumptions. You are not all knowing, nor is it ever cognitively sound to try to present yourself as the <em>only</em> person "in the know," so it seems you have your work cut out for you. I don't mean to be a hard-ass, but you've been under such heat from Page 1 of this thread because you simply have not presented any convincing evidence. We cannot and will not just take your word for it.</p>

<p>"I have no evidence" is the strongest possible reason to believe something isn't true. If I told you that I know absolutely that there are Martians living in my garage, would you simply accept this as fact unconditionally? If you didn't, would you assume that some form of mind control is preventing you from accepting my statement as true?</p>

<p>I told you my reason for not believing you. You vehemently disagree is proof to me that you are unable to comprehend logic.</p>

<p>That's what all mind control conspiracy fans say when the burden of proof is on them. They have no evidence, no test way to test their theory, and absolutely nothing to support their belief other than their words.</p>

<p>I linked you to a perfectly complete explanation of the Dendera reliefs.</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain I am more well versed on Egyptian mythology than you.  There is no reason to believe that there is no hidden meaning in the reliefs, however my interpretation is "obvious."  These are people that told stories with pictures, why don't you look at them and think about it, rather than relying on someone else's opinion.</p>
<p>Honestly, if everyone did that we'd have a significant portion of this forum thinking they had incandescent lightbulbs.  Oh wait, we probably do.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at this list. Is "alien mind control" the only possible answer, or are there more logical and terrestrial explanations?</p>
<p><strong>The Dendera Light:</strong> Already addressed in earlier posts. Changing the meaning of the inscriptions which accompany the relief to suit your personal agenda, does not actually change anything. This has to be understood from the proper context, and from the perspective of the ancient Egyptians. Anything outside those boundaries removes veracity from the equation. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Exodus: </strong>A mytho-historical fable underpinning the ancient Hebrew religion. There's no evidence this event ever even took place. It's a matter of religion. Religion began as a means in pre-scientific cultures for man to explain the "unexplainable." All religious traditions have some sort of creation story, and Exodus is one of the prime stories for Judaism. That's all it is. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Elusinian Mysteries, Alexander, and his teachers:</strong> The Eleusinian Mysteries were simply initiation rites for the cult of Demeter; this tradition was only one among numerous in the Greco-Roman world. It again brings us back to religion, which has nothing to do with visitors from outer space. Religion as a means to control is another matter, as Karl Marx was fond of saying, but that's quite a different thing from the spin you're putting on it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p>Alexander the Great was a Macedonian king and warlord. He had a couple of notable tutors, especially Aristotle, but as contemporary writers liked to infer, Alexander was not a shining student. He was obsessed with folding the known world into his own realm through the means of conquest. He was driven by the complicated relationship with his father and by his own profound restlessness, and that's the gist of it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Fall of Rome:</strong> A complicated subject still explored and debated by scholars, but not exactly mysterious. It involved multiple influences including social decay, intra-political divisions, the splitting of the state into East and West, corruption, the changing of socio-political norms in the Mediterranean world, and the advent of burgeoning and spreading barbarian tribes which could no longer be held back. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Creation of the RC Chruch:</strong> Once again we're back into the realm of religion, which has nothing to do with space visitors. The arrival of the Roman Catholic Church was actually a protracted and complicated social development that took centuries to ferment. From Christianity's origin as a minor Judaic sect to its official adoption in the Roman empire—these were but the beginnings. In all reality, when discussing the development of Catholicism, one might be more correct to express it as "creation<strong><em>s</em></strong>." Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Crusades:</strong> A series of wars presented as holy Christian undertakings while in fact part of a broader and complicated European socio-political movement. "Rescuing" the Holy Land from its Muslim "infidels" put a pretty package around it, as did the announcement that those participating would be absolved of all earthly sins, but I think anyone properly acquainted with the Crusades would know it was more than that. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>Several notable scientific accomplishments in Cambridge:</strong> Too vague to bear comment. Vague pronouncements do not bolster an argument, they weaken it. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The creation and rise of several secret societies, including Thule:</strong> Also overly vague. The fact is, pretty much all such societies are thinly veiled organizations allowing the privileged to band together and behave like naughty boys. While it's true that some "secret societies" strive to promote the success and advancement of its membership, in actuality these groups have little bearing or influence on wider human societies. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler:</strong> A very simple matter to understand, when framed by its proper context. Germany was roundly humiliated by its defeat in World War I and the subsequent social and economic proscriptions put upon it by the victorious nations of that war. Hitler was only one of numerous fist-pounding demagogues to have emerged in Germany after World War I. The German populace was ripe for strong and decisive leadership, in the same sort of way that weakened and desperate people seek the comfort and strength of a cult today. Hitler was just barely organized and driven enough to have carried it off and to have emerged as the new tyrant. Nothing to do with alien mind control.</p>
<p>I've been watching this discussion since its start, prometheuslocke, and have made a couple of posts of my own. As with others taking part herein, I am familiar with research protocols and how theories are properly formed and delivered. Not once, prometheuslocke, have I seen you properly defend a single one of your statements, or present adequate evidence on your part for your own cause. Simply listing things is not evidence. All it does is reflect your personal assumptions. Assumptions are not evidentiary, nor will they on their own ever win the day.</p>
<p>So I would suggest, if you wish to be taken seriously, return to the list above and present credible, empirical evidence to substantiate your assumptions. You are not all knowing, nor is it ever cognitively sound to try to present yourself as the <em>only</em> person "in the know," so it seems you have your work cut out for you. I don't mean to be a hard-ass, but you've been under such heat from Page 1 of this thread because you simply have not presented any convincing evidence. We cannot and will not just take your word for it.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I can't argue with someone that would make the statement that religion and aliens have nothing to do with each other, as if it were fact.  If that's your belief, we are too far opposed ideologically to ever come to a meeting of the minds.  I've been busy making my first video, but I will get back to providing you with empirical evidence of the links between those events.  It is actually, the entire point of my book.</p>
<p>Just to throw something out there, most of them have something to do with hallucinations, drug induced, or otherwise.  At least five of them.</p>
<p>Edit: here's something about Hitler's auditory hallucinations, and his belief in an external force with the ability to... alter history: <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-hidden-hand.html" rel="external nofollow">http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-hidden-hand.html</a></p>
<p>He spoke about a "dark force" often. In fact, many of our world leaders have... here's a few quotes:</p>
<p>“There is a power so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that prudent men better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it”</p>
<p>Woodrow T. Wilson</p>
<p>"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence — on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy</p>
<p>"I occasionally think, how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask is not an alien force already among us?"</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan</p>

<p>"I have no evidence" is the strongest possible reason to believe something isn't true.

<p>You have no place to choose where the "burden of proof" is.  This is not a court, its a discussion.  Deciding that I must prove my point, while you sit back and watch, is a cop out.  That's why I don't want to discuss it with you.</p>

I've found evidence of what I am a victim of in many historical and religious stories, but in order to see it, you really need to take at face value what I have witnessed first hand.  I understand that that is difficult to do, but it's apparently much more difficult to see the things I see without taking as <em>fact</em> that the technology exists.</p>
