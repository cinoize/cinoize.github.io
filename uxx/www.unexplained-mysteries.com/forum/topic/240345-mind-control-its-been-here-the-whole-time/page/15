The Egyptian myths of god\u0027s \"minds\" incarnating in human form (kings or not), is obviously mind control to me.  If you want to call it possession, that\u0027s fine... but they are functionally the same thing.  Possession by an outside force, whether complete or partial (of which both were described in Egyptian (and many other) religions) is mind control.  Just because there is no LSD administration, and it\u0027s not the CIA doing it, doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t functionally the same phenomenon. \n\nThat\u0027s a non answer, \"Kas of horus\" does not explain their positioning and actions in the picture. And once again, the inscriptions do not attribute them to Horus or Harsomptus. \nThey are holding nothing up, but I do agree that the djed and Heh are.  I believe this shows that they were seen as assisting the unseen force, which they called the ba of Horus. (Again to correct kmt_sesh earlier, it is clearly noted that it is his ba and not ka.) \n\nthey\u0027re... not.... Horus. \n\nYou cannot imagine any other possible explanation other than a neurological disorder to explain this belief?  This is the problem. \nI\u0027d love to talk about schizophrenia more with you, lets start another thread. \n\u0026lt;3 \n"

At no point did I argue that the serpent in the lotus bulb was not the ba of Horus\u2014I certainly would not say such a thing, given that the inscriptions clearly identify it as the ba. \nThe matter to which you\u0027re referring comes from an earlier post of yours where you claimed the bas of gods possessed people like avatars. I did respond to that post and requested that you provide a proper supporting reference for your claim. You still have not done so. Specifically, I pointed out that only kings believed they contained the life force or direct spirit essence of a god, and this was Horus. And it was the ka of Horus, not his ba. But again, I\u0027m offering you the chance to provide a proper supporting reference if you believe I\u0027m mistaken. \n\nThe figures are identified as Harsoumtus and his elements (ka, ba). I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re having such a hard time grasping this, but Harsomtus is Horus (the name means \"Horus, Uniter of the Two Lands\"). \nProviding I have adequate time this evening, I\u0027ll try to return to this discussion to respond to your recent posts in reply to mine. \n\nThat would be fine, but the Alternative History forum would not be the correct place for this topic. Please be sure to use the correct forum. \n"

            "text": "So the confusion is all clear to me now.  Harsomptus is the biological son of Horus, \"possessed\" by his ba.  \"Horus, uniter of two lands\" does not mean it is Horus, think like an Egyptian. \nHarwer (Haroeris), or \"Horus the Elder\" was the mature god represented in these stories who battles Seth for 80 years until the tribunal of gods finally awards him his rightful place on the throne of all Egypt. Finally, as Har-Mau or Harsomptus (Horus the Uniter), Horus fulfills this role of uniting and ruling over Egypt, though he is sometimes identified as the son of Horus the Elder and Hathor in this role, for example, at Edfu and Kom Ombo, and called by the name Panebtawy \"Lord of the Two Lands\". \nAccording to the Turin Canon, the late predynastic rulers of Egypt were \"followers of Horus\". By the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, the ruler was Horus. On the palette in the Cairo museum that shows King Narmer, considered a candidate for the first ruler of a unified Egypt, Horus is shown holding a rope that passes through the nose of the defeated northern rival. Hence, some Egyptologists believe that the source of the mythological conflict between Horus and Seth may have been the predynastic struggle to unite Upper and Lower Egypt \nhttp://www.touregypt...m#ixzz2PAQCiPCx \n. \nHarsomptus had a different name because he was a real person. His name alone substantiates the claim that he was possessed or thought of as being the spirit of his biological father, Horus.   \nThe Harsomtus version of Horus can be traced back to the Pyramid Texts as Har-mau or \"Horus the uniter.\" The idea is the king as upholder of the unification of North and South Egypt. Since in temple dogma the divine child of a god and goddess could be thought a manifestation of the pharaoh, Harsomtus is used merely as \"filling\" in a sacred triad. He is e.g. the son of the elder Horus and Hathor at Edfu temple. Similarly at the temple of Kom-Ombo the same couple are the parents of Harsomtus under the name of Pa-neb-tawy or \"lord of the Two Lands.\"  \nhttp://www.philvaz.c...etics/HORUS.htm \nThis concept, that the ba of Horus would be incarnated is, as you said yourself, common in Egyptian themes.  The pharoah\u0027s all claimed to be incarnations of Horus. There is no functional difference between a God incarnating in the Pharoah, than possessing him.  Also no functional difference between possession and the recipient\u0027s mind being controlled by the God.  I think the only contention left is whether or not the Egyptians believed what they were saying, and I think it should be clear that they did.  (The alternative of course, that \"divine mandate\" was just something the ruling class used to control the population... which is most likely true later; however it is possible that it was based on an actual phenomenon which is the foundation of this belief and mythology.) \nPyramid texts ca. the 25th Century BC describe the nature of the Pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The Pharaoh as Horus in life became the Pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he was united with the rest of the gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new pharaohs. \nLook at it this way, two gods screw and have a human baby.  What happened? You have a new biological body, with the mind of the father inside it. \nI don\u0027t see how anyone could argue against mind control or possession being a possible explanation of this. \n"

I\u0027m merely showing you something that is obviously mind control, and letting you show your true colors, that you will argue against whatever I say based on principle.  The story inside quantum leap is about a quantum physicist, who uses a machine in order to take over the mind of random people throughout space and time.  He controls their actions completely.  There is no question that it is machine assisted mind control. \nThe fact that this group first disagrees that Quantum Leap depicts a form of \"mind control,\" and then once called out, falls back on the position that its a \"fiction story\" anyway, just proves my point even more.  This group is not attempting to have a discussion, you are arguing for the sake of winning. \nIt closely parallels a large portion of our discussion, whether or not Egyptian mythology in general, and the Dendera crypt reliefs in particular have any relation to mind control.  I believe both show significant evidence of this, even in classical literature, though nobody has interpreted the reliefs as I have.  That does not make me wrong.  When I provide convincing evidence of this, it i summarily ignored by this group.  Several posts later, many of you will then claim to have refuted my argument, when in fact, you have not.  It\u0027s getting boring. \nNot one of you has answered the most important question I see relating to these reliefs (aside from Harte, I think, who does not agree with my \"visual\" interpretation of the image, which is supported by the inscriptions).  \nBetween the two images, the figures described as ka change their position, in one they appear to me (and I think anyone that actually looks at the picture), to be praying or worshipping Harsomptus.  In the second, they are united in a male-female relationship, and ignoring Harsomptus.  WHY? \nI\u0027ve taken the liberty of putting together this diagram for you. \n \n"

To my dismay, you have allowed the truth to pummel you into another ring, over and over again.  You pretend that you are not being hit, but it is obvious from the sidelines.  Just because your enemy is unseen, does not mean you are not losing. \nYour loss is not against me, but rather against yourselves.  You have failed to come out of this ring with more knowledge than when you entered, despite the truth staring you in the face, the whole time.  Rather, your eyes have been beat shut, and they are now swollen and drunk with the wrath of the father of lies. \n"

I am sure that you will continue to ignore the facts and evidence in favor of the fantasy and will continue to claim your hollow victories but in the end it is not good to delude yourself. \n"

</div></blockquote>
<p>In the pic, the figures "on knees with bent arms" are two Kas of Horus.</p>
<p>They are holding up, or "uplifting" Horus' aura (my term - translated as "the perfection of Horus.")</p>
<p>The djed in the pic is performing the same function, only it upholds Horus' body itself (the snake in the lotus.)</p>
<p>I'm not an ancient Egyptian priest, expert in the religion, but it seems to me that it is unlikely that Horus' invisible doubles would pray to themselves (Horus.)</p>

<p><strong>Quantum Leap was Possession</strong>, because the other persons mind went elsewhere. There was no direct or indirect mind control. Only exchanging of minds.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>I think I'd amend this to say <strong>possession via time travel</strong> since Scott Bakula's character was constantly swapping places with people from different points in time. As opposed to normal possession which is usually presented as being in the persons own timeframe. But yeah, it's still not mind control.</p>

<p>I'm just trying to understand why you don't see mind control where I clearly do.  It's becoming more apparent to me.  The Egyptian myths of god's "minds" incarnating in human form (kings or not), is obviously mind control to me.  If you want to call it possession, that's fine... but they are functionally the same thing.  Possession by an outside force, whether complete or partial (of which both were described in Egyptian (and many other) religions) <strong>is mind control.  Just because there is no LSD administration, and it's not the CIA doing it, doesn't mean they aren't functionally the same phenomenon.</strong></p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-contentid="240345" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic"><div>
<p>In the pic, the figures "on knees with bent arms" are two Kas of Horus.</p>
<p>They are holding up, or "uplifting" Horus' aura (my term - translated as "the perfection of Horus.")</p>
<p>The djed in the pic is performing the same function, only it upholds Horus' body itself (the snake in the lotus.)</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That's a non answer, "Kas of horus" does not explain their positioning and actions in the picture. And once again, the <strong>inscriptions do not attribute them to Horus or Harsomptus.</strong></p>
<p>They are holding nothing up, but I do agree that the djed and Heh are.  I believe this shows that they were seen as assisting the unseen force, which they called the <strong>ba of Horus.</strong> (Again to correct kmt_sesh earlier, it is clearly noted that it is his <strong>ba</strong> and not <strong>ka.)</strong></p>

<p>I'm not an ancient Egyptian priest, expert in the religion, but it seems to me that it is unlikely that Horus' invisible doubles would pray to themselves (Horus.)</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>they're... not.... Horus.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentcommentid="4716999" data-ipsquote-username="Harte" data-cite="Harte" data-ipsquote-timestamp="1364574020" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-contentid="240345" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic"><div>
<p>That, I can agree with.  Not the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fact</span> of being possessed by another or a demon (necessarily,) but in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">belief</span> that such a thing has or is occuring.</p>
<p>So now we're back to schizophrenia.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You cannot imagine any other possible explanation other than a neurological disorder to explain this belief?  This is the problem.</p>
<p>I'd love to talk about schizophrenia more with you, lets start another thread.</p>

Possession by an outside force, whether complete or partial (of which both were described in Egyptian (and many other) religions) <strong>is mind control.

<p>They are holding nothing up, but I do agree that the djed and Heh are.  I believe this shows that they were seen as assisting the unseen force, which they called the <strong>ba of Horus.</strong> (Again to correct kmt_sesh earlier, it is clearly noted that it is his <strong>ba</strong> and not <strong>ka.)</strong></p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Please try to read my responses more carefully. I don't like to be misrepresented, even if by accident. At no point did I argue that the serpent in the lotus bulb was not the ba of Horus—I certainly would not say such a thing, given that the inscriptions clearly identify it as the ba.</p>
<p>The matter to which you're referring comes from an earlier post of yours where you claimed the bas of gods possessed people like avatars. I <em>did</em> respond to that post and requested that you provide a proper supporting reference for your claim. You still have not done so. Specifically, I pointed out that only kings believed they contained the life force or direct spirit essence of a god, and this was Horus. And it was the ka of Horus, not his ba. But again, I'm offering you the chance to provide a proper supporting reference if you believe I'm mistaken.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-contentid="240345" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic"><div>they're... not.... Horus.</div></blockquote>
<p>The figures are identified as Harsoumtus and his elements (ka, ba). I'm not sure why you're having such a hard time grasping this, but Harsomtus <em>is</em> Horus (the name means "Horus, Uniter of the Two Lands").</p>
<p>Providing I have adequate time this evening, I'll try to return to this discussion to respond to your recent posts in reply to mine.</p>

<p>That would be fine, but the Alternative History forum would not be the correct place for this topic. Please be sure to use the correct forum.</p>

<p>Please try to read my responses more carefully. I don't like to be misrepresented, even if by accident. At no point did I argue that the serpent in the lotus bulb was not the ba of Horus—I certainly would not say such a thing, given that the inscriptions clearly identify it as the ba.</p>
<p>The matter to which you're referring comes from an earlier post of yours where you claimed the bas of gods possessed people like avatars. I <em>did</em> respond to that post and requested that you provide a proper supporting reference for your claim. You still have not done so. Specifically, I pointed out that only kings believed they contained the life force or direct spirit essence of a god, and this was Horus. And it was the ka of Horus, not his ba. But again, I'm offering you the chance to provide a proper supporting reference if you believe I'm mistaken.</p>
<p>The figures are identified as Harsoumtus and his elements (ka, ba). I'm not sure why you're having such a hard time grasping this, but Harsomtus <em>is</em> Horus (the name means "Horus, Uniter of the Two Lands").</p>
<p>Providing I have adequate time this evening, I'll try to return to this discussion to respond to your recent posts in reply to mine.</p>
<p>That would be fine, but the Alternative History forum would not be the correct place for this topic. Please be sure to use the correct forum.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So the confusion is all clear to me now.  Harsomptus is the biological son of Horus, "possessed" by his ba.  "Horus, uniter of two lands" does not mean it is Horus, think like an Egyptian.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Harwer (Haroeris), or "Horus the Elder" was the mature god represented in these stories who battles Seth for 80 years until the tribunal of gods finally awards him his rightful place on the throne of all Egypt. Finally, as Har-Mau or Harsomptus (Horus the Uniter), Horus fulfills this role of uniting and ruling over Egypt, though he is sometimes</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong> identified as the son of Horus the Elder and </strong></span></span></span><a href="http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/hathor.htm" rel="external nofollow"><strong>Hathor</strong></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong> in this role,</strong></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"> for example, at Edfu and Kom Ombo, and called by the name Panebtawy "Lord of the Two Lands".</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">According to the Turin Canon, the late predynastic rulers of Egypt were "followers of Horus". By the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, the ruler was Horus. On the palette in the Cairo museum that shows </span></span></span><a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/narmer.htm" rel="external nofollow">King Narmer</a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">, considered a candidate for the first ruler of a unified Egypt, Horus is shown holding a rope that passes through the nose of the defeated northern rival. Hence, some Egyptologists believe that the source of the mythological conflict between Horus and Seth may have been the predynastic struggle to unite Upper and Lower Egypt</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/horus.htm#ixzz2PAQCiPCx" rel="external nofollow">http://www.touregypt...m#ixzz2PAQCiPCx</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Harsomptus had a different name because he was a <em>real person.</em> His name alone substantiates the claim that he was possessed or thought of as being the spirit of his biological father, Horus.  </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The </span><em>Harsomtus</em><span style="color:#000000;"> version of Horus can be traced back to the Pyramid Texts as </span><em>Har-mau</em><span style="color:#000000;"> or "Horus the uniter." The idea is the king as upholder of the unification of North and South Egypt. Since in temple dogma the divine child of a god and goddess could be thought a manifestation of the pharaoh, </span><em>Harsomtus</em><span style="color:#000000;"> is used merely as "filling" in a sacred triad. </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is e.g. the son of the elder Horus and Hathor</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"> at Edfu temple. Similarly at the temple of Kom-Ombo the same couple are the parents of </span><em>Harsomtus</em><span style="color:#000000;"> under the name of </span><em>Pa-neb-tawy</em><span style="color:#000000;"> or "lord of the Two Lands." </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/HORUS.htm" rel="external nofollow">http://www.philvaz.c...etics/HORUS.htm</a></p>
<p>This concept, that the ba of Horus would be incarnated is, as you said yourself, common in Egyptian themes.  The pharoah's all claimed to be incarnations of Horus. <span style="font-size:14px;">There is no functional difference between a God incarnating in the Pharoah, than possessing him.  Also no functional difference between possession and the recipient's mind being controlled by the God.  I think the only contention left is whether or not the Egyptians </span><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>believed</strong></span><span style="font-size:14px;"> what they were saying, and I think it should be clear that they did.  (The alternative of course, that "divine mandate" was just something the ruling class used to control the population... which is most likely true later; however it is possible that it was based on an actual phenomenon which is the foundation of this belief and mythology.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#B8BABB;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="background-color:transparent;">Pyramid texts ca. the 25th Century BC describe the nature of the Pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The Pharaoh as Horus in life became the Pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he was united with the rest of the gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new pharaohs.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Look at it this way, two gods screw and have a human baby.  What happened? You have a new biological body, with the mind of the father inside it.</p>
<p>I don't see how anyone could argue against mind control or possession being a possible explanation of this.</p>

<p>Mind control is taking control of the mind by another person or device.</p>
<p>One persons mind taking control of another persons body (having a direct affect on the muscles) is not mind control.</p>
<p>If you remember Quantum Leap, Sams mind was swapped with the mind of another.  He was in their body in the past while they found themselves in his body in the future.   Mind swapping is not mind control.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Neural Stimulation and Recording</strong></p>
<p>The type of "mind control" we talk about at MoFK has nothing to do with subconscious messages through advertising and television.  It's not related to flickering lights, or "brain wave entrainment."  For the effects we have noticed, these things are really, really stupid suggestions as mechanisms.</p>
<p>Real mind control involves the activation and suppression of action potentials, the firing of an individual neuron, in a pattern which creates a real effect in the brain of humans.  Neurons fire in patterns, and in groups, and the result of these firing patterns is thoughts, feelings, movements, etc.  It is scientifically possible to cause these firing patterns to be activated remotely, without the use of an implant, by "injecting" electricity into individual neurons using advanced technology.</p>
<p>For the last 5 decades, U.S. intelligence has done a significant amount of research and development into a technology called "TEMPEST."  This technology was originally used in order to reconstruct usable information from monitors, integrated circuits, etc in order to remotely surveil electronic devices.  Later, technology was developed which was able to do the reverse, and cause these machines to act in a certain manner.</p>
<p>Human brains are, for our purposes, just advanced machines.  Their actions, and your consciousness, are the product of electrical impulses, and the technology surrounding "TEMPEST" could be modified to take control of, and remotely surveil the thoughts and feelings of human beings.</p>
<p>Throw in a "bit" of neuroscience research, and you have the proverbial Manchurian Candidate... and with a bit of infrastructure buildout, Orwell's prophesy fullfiled.</p>
<p><strong>There's proof that this technology is perfected, and it's all around you.</strong>  A Lockheed Martin researcher spoke about it publicly in 1999, and it may have gotten him killed.  John Norseen had a lot to say about mind control.  NASA has talked about its potential use in airports.  There are a significant number of victims complaining about it all over the world.</p>

<p>That would be one definition.</p>

<p>You make up things to further your argument over, and over. It's a p*** poor habit.  I never cited it as factual reference, I used it to show you that nobody here has a clue what mind control actually is.  It's pretty funny that every single person arguing against me has now basically shown that they just simply do not understand what they are arguing about.</p>

<p>So you cite a fictional example of something you think is mind control - that has no bearing at all on your original argument - and claim some form of debating victory over everyone because no I've else can see what the hell you're getting at.</p>
<p>So what if Quantum Leap is mind control?! It does nothing to bolster your original argument and if anything only makes it look flimsier as its obvious you don't really have an argument.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Quantum Leap is not the point.  I'm merely showing you something that is obviously mind control, and letting you show your true colors, that you will argue against whatever I say based on principle.  The story inside quantum leap is about a quantum physicist, who uses a machine in order to take over the mind of random people throughout space and time.  He controls their actions completely.  There is no question that it is machine assisted mind control.</p>
<p>The fact that this group first disagrees that Quantum Leap depicts a form of "mind control," and then once called out, falls back on the position that its a "fiction story" anyway, just proves my point even more.  This group is not attempting to have a discussion, you are arguing for the sake of winning.</p>
<p>It closely parallels a large portion of our discussion, whether or not Egyptian mythology in general, and the Dendera crypt reliefs in particular have any relation to mind control.  I believe both show significant evidence of this, even in classical literature, though nobody has interpreted the reliefs as I have.  That does not make me wrong.  When I provide convincing evidence of this, it i summarily ignored by this group.  Several posts later, many of you will then claim to have refuted my argument, when in fact, you have not.  It's getting boring.</p>
<p>Not one of you has answered the most important question I see relating to these reliefs (aside from Harte, I think, who does not agree with my "visual" interpretation of the image, which is supported by the inscriptions). </p>
<p>Between the two images, the figures described as ka change their position, in one they appear to me (and I think anyone that actually looks at the picture), to be praying or worshipping Harsomptus.  In the second, they are united in a male-female relationship, and ignoring Harsomptus.  WHY?</p>
<p>I've taken the liberty of putting together this diagram for you.</p>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and claim victory, once again.</p>
<p>At this point I'd like to leave you all with a little message.  There is truth in fiction.</p>
<p><strong>1984</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE MATRIX</strong></p>
<p><strong>QUANTUM LEAP</strong></p>
<p><strong>STARGATE SG-1</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLADERUNNER (DADOES)</strong></p>
<p><strong>MINORITY REPORT</strong></p>
<p><strong>TOTAL RECALL</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">STAR WARS</span></p>
<p>BACK TO THE FUTURE</p>
<p>ALIEN</p>
<p>COCOON</p>
<p>These movies all have common themes, not only that, but many of them originated from the same artists.  Once humanity knows that this technology not only exists, but has an extraterrestrial origin, that will tell you one of two things.</p>
<p>1) Robert Zemeckis and Phillip K. Dick knew about it, a long time ago.</p>
<p>2) or, they were "inspired," using the very same technology.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;3  </strong>(I couldn't leave without giving you something to tear up... I'm <strong>right</strong>, by the way. <img src="../../../uploads/emoticons/default_original.gif" alt=":)" srcset="../../../uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="18" height="18" /> )</p>

<p>What victory?</p>
<p>Seriously???</p>

<p>Speaking of ignoring, I showed you where you were wrong about Quantum Leap but you conveniently ignored it.</p>
<p>To show you some of your self imposed illusion, In post #87 you said this at the very beginning "<strong>You are in luck, I've been saying aliens are behind it, since the first post!</strong>"   If you reread all your posts between the first and number 87, in none of them do you discuss or even mention aliens using mind control.</p>
<p>Your claimed victories are indeed not victories but IMO the desperate attempt by someone who has had their hypothesis refuted at nearly every point and does not or can not conceive that they are wrong.  I am sure that you will continue to ignore the facts and evidence in favor of the fantasy and will continue to claim your hollow victories but in the end it is not good to delude yourself.</p>
