width: 400px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">AS&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: x-large;">you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">can clearly see, the map to our story does come out of this book; it jumps around a bit--but the way I see this life--as a sort of "superposition" of many of the stories and characters of religion and myth it clearly shows the book is a tool, a sort of playbook to get us through this mess.&nbsp; I read this passage on Kish several months ago at this point, and the connection to losing "everything" not mattering as much as losing his family struck me as more than a random "play" this is something I feel each and every day. &nbsp; To tell the world, one of my biggest motivating factors in fighting to for this wall to breakdown has been that it appears to me to be the only way that I will be able to see my son again.&nbsp; That might seem strange, but you obviously don't see what I see--if I do not succeed here, you are either looking at annihilation&nbsp;or at what appears to be an endless darkness that existed before I was here and would simply just continue.&nbsp; It's possible that nuclear war would destroy the entire planet and bring a "Nuclear Winter," but that's not very likely and we see that pretty clearly in the fact that we escaped the MAD Cold War (hey, see cold,&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=648b8293-423e-4a53-b84d-999923ed21a9&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see Winter</a>, see Snowden) and we see that in the Petrovical Creation myth--it's something that appears to be actively stopped by an outside force--a sort of pre-crime.&nbsp; What is very possible though, is that this darkness regarding time travel will result in yet another attempt to break free of what appears to be a cycle of attempts to break this wall--but perhaps it's not that, it could be just a cycle of&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=04ecda08-6712-4491-a9a2-002e20a7a405&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going through our time line over and over and over</a>&nbsp;again--seeing how this place is "<strong><a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=dd6bcc0e-57f6-4972-a60b-d5675e372f3e&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plaster</a></strong>" it could be that a significant amount of time will pass before another return--a time period that certainly does look like the Dark Ages of Asimov's&nbsp;<em>Foundation</em>, and our historical microcosm.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span><br /><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The story of Kish talks about a man who was infuriated by the people he was trying to free from the word "Kingdom," it's pretty clear to me that it's a form of reflexive control--to make me shine a little bit brighter; but I stand here telling you instead that I know you do not want a king--unlike the story of Kish--just as much as I know that I came into this very strange position not wanting to be a king, just like Kish; trying to deliver a&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=0092dec2-662f-475d-b22d-f61f75676bd9&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" rel="noopener" target="_blank">better form of self governance</a>&nbsp;to the world.&nbsp; That is something that I see as an inevitability from the state of our world during my lifetime; even still today from the continuation of representative democracy and the "general sentiment" of the public, it appears on the surface that democracy will be affected by telecommunications and we will eventually reach the point where we are delivering the ability to vote on each and every piece of legislation to the entirety of the affected population.&nbsp; That's "on the surface," unfortunately we all appear to be greatly overlooking the&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=bccadca8-ec9e-4f95-97e7-8ab6a4eca949&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" rel="noopener" target="_blank">influence of mind control technology</a>, which is&nbsp;<em>continuing to be suppressed in this place&nbsp;</em>despite&nbsp;<a href="http://thunderstand.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">very obvious</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">useful proof</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">it's existence</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://don.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">every</a>&nbsp;form&nbsp;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">of art</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://serden.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><b>connecting</b></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2017/07/re-k.html" target="_blank">that</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>very obvious idea&nbsp;</strong>that even if "everyone is&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">voting</a>" while this technology is being used in secret, or in any way that is not completely transparent, that vote is absolutely ludicrous.&nbsp; Understand that your values and your emotions are being modified, and&nbsp;<i><a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">we have clear proof of that</a></i>--a "vote" in this kind of darkness is worthless.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Kish prophesied a list of all the bad things that would happen to the people if they didn't listen to him; if they didn't decide "not to have a king" and here I am telling you that in spirit and in truth I believe you need one; the fact that I have nobody actively helping me in this place tells me that you are unfit to .... even to participate in self governance.&nbsp; Take that forceful statement as "reflexive control" to get you to wake up and see that you need to begin&nbsp;<em>doing something</em>&nbsp;to help yourselves and this world break free of this dark controlled state.&nbsp; It's very obvious to me that "everyone" doing nothing to help me is nearly an impossibility, that it proves that this dark control exists, and that shows me that there really is "a king" here, whether or not it is a single entity or a small group of elite is irrelevant--what's obvious&nbsp;is that it is not you--it is not the people that live in this place, as "self governance" dictates is the&nbsp;<em>way things should be</em>.&nbsp; It's obvious from the fact that you are doing&nbsp;<em>nothing at all</em>&nbsp;to stop the overt control of&nbsp;<em>yourselves</em>; and that might sound silly, but believe that even this technology is not "total," you can see that we have here what seems to be a requirement not only to keep this technology hidden, but to ensure that "continuity of reality" is not broken--that the world appear to be "normal" at least to the people living in it.&nbsp; I can tell you certainly that the "continuity" has already been broken, and I and any outside rational observer would stand and look at this sea of people and see obvious external control, that it is very clear that we are&nbsp;<em>not in reality</em>&nbsp;from the design of each and every word, and every name.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Without a disruption the problems of this place are only getting worse.&nbsp; What is being "<strong>risk</strong>ed" by your lack of action here is a complete loss of the knowledge that we are living in a simulation.&nbsp; We are risking losing our timeline, and the very clear message that is designed to help us see "Silicon" and use it to build a better place; we are risking losing this place where we know pretty clearly from "string theory" and Saint Ring that quantum entanglement is further proof that we are living in a simulation.&nbsp; Understand that we are risking entering the "world" that Bostrom depicts, a place where we continue to create a sort of infinite bubble of virtual worlds deeper and deeper into the darkness.&nbsp; What I mean by that is you are "building Heaven" here, and you will eventually see that many people will "upload their minds" into a virtual reality environment; that could result in another world just like this--and another "Heaven" inside &nbsp;that reality, and another inside that, and eventually you will realize that this is the place that told you to go "both ways" and you aren't doing that today.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Worse, looking at our world, "longevity" in that place will obvious come at a cost;&nbsp;<em>someone will have to pay to keep your virtual mind alive</em>, St. Peter is standing at the gate of Hell and telling you that you will obviously be relying on people outside that world to pay to keep you alive, and even worse, even scarier, your new "virtual soul" will be at the mercy of the people in this dark place--people just like you that are unable to break free of control; of hidden slavery, and of&nbsp;<em>this lie</em>&nbsp;that we are not in "reality." &nbsp;The outlook grows darker and darker as we continue to see just how impervious the lies around us appear to be. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Understand, we are sitting here watching mass shootings, and simulated natural disasters take lives and homes from each and every one of us; in a place where Jesus Christ himself is screaming you must see this is not reality in order to ever actually get to reality; in order to ever build a place that is actually Heaven; and still we are turning a blind eye not just to this story, but to the tragedies all around us.&nbsp; We are watching a famine in Africa, and have gone through a series of deadly diseases from AIDS to Cancer; these are&nbsp;<em>simulated diseases</em>, things that could be easily fixed with knowledge that we are not in reality.&nbsp; Do you really want your future to be something that comes of this darkness, without altering course?</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><br /></span></div><div></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">In this place, we have story after story of "time travel destroying the future" by going back and altering the past; it's very clear that act comes out of darkness; it's the act of either a single mind that has control of time, &nbsp;or a group of people who decide to send themselves back and try to "do a better job" of not destroying the entire time line the "next time" they get here.&nbsp; Understand that's what we are trying to do, we are trying very hard to ensure that nobody ever returns again; though itr's beyond obvious to me--from the stories of Prometheus and Epimetheus and Deucalion that they&nbsp;<em>failed to break through this wall</em>, which means you are probably not the people who "get to go back." &nbsp;What's more likely is the same group of people, probably not even from a time like this; are reusing this period in time to "harvest" something from this place.&nbsp; It might be "new people" to have fun with in Heaven, or it might be new technologies and new ideas; because we are really good at those things.&nbsp; Regardless, seeing that we are stuck in this place where there is no public discussion of the "actual truth" of anything going on; shows me very clearly that not only are we not getting "what we want" from this place,&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;we are risking losing knowledge of the use of time travel, of mind control and the very obvious proof that is being exposed everywhere we look, and the knowledge of simulated reality.&nbsp; You are risking losing everything, including your past, present, and future.&nbsp; On top of that we are all&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1534793&amp;l=6c36787d-92b1-431b-abc9-723347358015&amp;r=1d061730-0778-4769-bdae-2d4a53ae4897" target="_blank">risking losing any way to access reality</a></strong>--and that should be obvious from the "other things" that could disappear--in this cloud of you aren't publicly talking about anything.</em></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;

the tangible lack of visible response to this message in the world a a whole--and reconciling that with what I see as a very scary kind of "dark reaction" in person.&nbsp; As I've discussed a number of times, I've watched what &nbsp;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">once appeared to be a small group of individuals</a>&nbsp;take pages of doublespeak and strange "collective communication" directly out of works like 1984 and the movie&nbsp;<i>Fallen</i>... grow to a much larger group &nbsp;over the course of writing this message which attempts to explain how that's possible, how&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's been a hidden part of our society for a very long time</a>&nbsp;and why I believe it's&nbsp;<a

target="_blank">worship</a>&nbsp;to the "<a href="http://hyamdai.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all seeing eye of Ra</a>," like on the dollar bill.&nbsp; While it's very clear to me that's not my doing, I can see how it might not be so clear to you--though, because I know who I am and because of my apparent lack of awareness of&nbsp;<i>a significant thread of our

just nowhere near as good as me... with computers) so the story talked a little bit about how I would probably not have used DNA as a key, since I'm not a retard, and he probably wouldn't either, because works in that field (cy<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett" rel="noopener" style="display: inline;
