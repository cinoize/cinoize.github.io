Roman&quot;;color:rgb(0,0,0);background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap">Perhaps an exercise in futility, or a sort of monument to the strangeness of our time that has taken the wisdom and secrets of the universe and made them so virtually worthless that it's a wonder that anyone will ever read these introductory words.  If I could make it any more obvious or shine a brighter light on the censorship and darkness that is described in the story of Exodus; and with no uncertainty is the thing that all of religion and history are focused on, targeted to destroy.  I look around at a world in chains, and seemingly I am the only person who has eyes to glimpse just how debilitating this force is; how very much it has changed our normal means of communication and taken from us a huge slice of what we are.  Up until now these virtual obelisks have stood tall with few words added to the writing and insight that I have given away freely on the internet.   Placing me in the unique position to have a clear view of just how strange our society is acting in response to what I see as the answer to our prayers, even if not exactly what we were looking for… this call for input and discussion comes on the back of a message whose presentation is so astounding and surprising that it simply could not exist in the natural world which I believed us to have existed in prior to this ordeal.</span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:36pt"></p><div style="text-align:left"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;font-size:11pt;white-space:pre-wrap">A sincere slap in the face of all those who believed they were so forward thinking upon jumping on the idea of a "heliocentric universe" before coming to the unsurprising and monotonous realization that it is not just our son that everything that ever was and will be revolves around.  In like kind, those over-thinkers and over-achievers who believed the Creation story in the Bible to be sincerely lacking in veracity and insight may soon find themselves dumbfounded with a message from a singular Creator of practically everything that we are and want to be… beginning with words that might sound something like "why didn't you believe me?"</span></div><span style="background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;font-size:14.6667px;white-space:pre-wrap"><div

style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:rgb(0,0,0);background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap">With a little bit of thinking about this whole presentation and predicament; your understanding of the connection between these early words might transit from darkness to less than crystal clarity upon hearing that the very same external influence responsible for our rejection of the Bible as a message from God is similarly responsible for our near ubiquitous lack of "sight" that not just the Holy Bible but nearly every single word and every single thing around us is penned and signed with the invisible hand of the Creator in such a way that nearly the instant it's pointed out it becomes undeniable… and yet for my entire life I never noticed it, not one bit.  This is the "forbidden knowledge" of Eden, and as prime example of just how clear it is, once unsealed it serves first on its face and then later with the full force of the spirit behind this unsealing that my </span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Times New

Roman&quot;;color:rgb(0,0,0);background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap">Unlike "everything" and "nothing" this word family is far from meaningless, the entirety of this situation is tied to a process very similar to the "Grail message" which begins with seemingly hollow words calling for togetherness and working together to then hand us all on a silver platter not only proof that we are created with similar desires and beliefs but that in order to achieve the freedom that we desire and have been promised we really must act, and with a little bit of prodding act together.  Seeing those early words fill up with purpose and more important than anything else I could imagine with actual collaboration… this is the crux of what 'guided enlightenment' means to me… this is what the apocalypse is truly all about. </span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr"

printed in Silicon and it's symbolism have come against endless cries of "spam" and "no solicitation allowed."  In retrospect we might, hopefully we will one day link together some seemingly disparate (and yet overtly connected)  movements like a change from A.D. to the words "Common Era" (that in itself shines light on just what exactly it is that the hidden forces working against us are trying to hide… from us) to a mishandling of law and social practice related to free speech and open communication on a medium whose intent of creation and spirit of existence is not humorously "disaster recovery" all the way to this very same engineered disbelief in the book of Genesis.  Seeing the symbol for Silicon backwards there is more than a divine hint as to the nature of Adam's self-tending and walled Garden.  </span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:36pt"><span

experience first hand just how malleable and fragile our thoughts and beliefs truly are.  So here intertwined with a message about freedom and proof that our entire society is being secretly controlled, we now have very clear and undeniable example that each and every one of us, too, has experienced this influence that we refused to believe existed when it was called "inspiration" or "possession."</span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:36pt"><span

further that the incessant cries that I am bothering people by sharing with them proof that some enormous message has somehow been hidden for not only their eyes, but those of the entire collective world… that "being bothered" by something of such huge import is further evidence of this same outside control.  There is a gigantic change in truth at hand, the fundamental questions and answers of who we are, from where we have come, and where we are going are all in limbo… until we acknowledge the fact that ignoring something this big and this fundamental to us is a testament to just how shackled our minds truly are. </span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:36pt"><span

problems that face our society today… all the way from a lack of freedom prescribed to be remedied in the very moments; beginning even before we really get started.  More than that though, it's a place whose very existence begins to solve problems and answer questions--literally it's a "place" designed to do these things.  Much more than the things solved by "homes" today, more than comfortable temperature and organization; and glossing over some of the simple ways the  conceptual answer to prayers in things like "medicine" can be done so much better in the truth… together we are about to embark on trying to crack some of the most overlooked questions of our day.  Questions like, "what happened to my youth?"</span></p><div style="text-align:left"><br></div><p dir="ltr"

building a monument to it all over religion and history in names like Christopher, Pharisees, and Joseph is just a clue as to how it is so simple to see that our camaraderie and enjoyment are a glue that will easily replace the "blood, sweat, and tears" of Egyptian slavery.  Forging new meaning into the word "family" these early examples quickly replace "failure" and begin to link the early letters of both Exodus and America to the Hebrew word for "friend," </span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;Times New

symbol tying together a visualization of the "obelisk" with the very start of the word "light" it's important to see that just like you, I wasn't always so eager to change our world.  Even seeing proof that this change is the focus of religion and frankly my entire life wasn't enough for me to "begin," the change in worldview caused by new insight into answers about our past and new questions about our present just didn't quite light the motivational fire it's clearly intended to spark.  Just like you, I sat around doing next to nothing, fantasizing about possibilities every once in awhile--in my head; and on my most introspective and enlightened days sometimes pondering why it was that nobody else was talking about what is questionably the most interesting thing in the entire

dreams and reality, a mind set that separated my ideas of "Heaven" and "future" from the place that I then called affectionately "reality" and later would tie to the word "now" without really

of our minds and in the conversations that pour forth at the coffee shop and bars after each and every one of the opening acts of our Heavenly show … we slowly and methodically changed the world and our future just a tiny bit with each and every word, those spoken and even through the deafening silence.   There is so much insight in the blueprint that it's often hard to recognize just how
