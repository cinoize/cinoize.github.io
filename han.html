<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">There&#39;s plenty of research now, philosophy and statistics coming from people like Nick Bostrom; work that basically implies that there&#39;s almost zero chance at all that we are not living in a &quot;simulation within a simulation&quot; and thinking about it, when you start to think about it you&#39;ll probably agree that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Though, here, we have a chance to gaze at what the &quot;embedding&quot; of OLE (as a key, it&#39;s one of my keys) and what a &quot;line feed down&quot; actually means--that&#39;s not a place where anyone will just magically wake up and be inside a &quot;second bubble&quot; deeper in this strange concept of simulations within simulations that ... Rick and Morty ... for instance ... lit up for the kids.&nbsp; What it really means is forcing this world to pretend they are in reality, and in that pretense ... themselves creating an entire infrastructure for mind uploading and for immortality--servers probably owned by governments and major international corporations that might &quot;sell&quot; to you (and then to your children, who I imagine would have to support your continued playing in ... heaven within hell within heaven) the prospect of not having to have a body to decay and grow old, but rather ... give you exactly what I&#39;m trying to explain is the fruit of responding to this message about already being in &quot;hell wthin heaven&quot; and turning it into something better.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">So I can&#39;t personally think of any reason anyone ... anywhere ... would want a layer of Zombies between Heaven and another Heaven; I certainly see it as a very scary prospect, that anyone here would want or desire to be &quot;in control&quot; of an entire world of fantasy growing beneath them--all the while knowing in their hearts that they themselves have no actual control over their own faculties or facilities and that .. well, something very immoral is happening now and would continue to happen until we decide that it&#39;s not OK to &quot;starve babies&quot; or to torture&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;with &quot;advanced mind control technology.&quot;&nbsp; This place is the line, I imagine it&#39;s always been something like that, why the Rock of Ages and the Ancient of Days are here to demand and confront some young ghosts in their dastardly plans to ... lie themselves into oblivion.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I mean, I think we get the idea ... around online voting, and workflow and how those things might combine in some not-as-distant-as-you-think future to help us build a sort of software based infrastructure to avoid things like government shut downs over whether or not we should be able to make an invisible wall between bullets and kids heads.&nbsp; Seriously, we shouldn&#39;t have to have a total system shut down to have a public conversation about how everyone knows (you do, right?) that we&#39;re living in a simulated reality, and how that means something ... really specific about the message telling us it&#39;s very simple to turn your bullets into potpourri in mid-air based on what they&#39;re going to hit.&nbsp; Anyway I&#39;m sort of congealing and mixing two disparate thoughts together here, but the point is I really want to take this software, the &quot;round table&quot; or the &quot;sword&quot; or whatever and make it priority two--even though it should be pretty high up there.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to make that invisible wall ... like the most important fucking thing that has ever been thought, and I want to make it happen even if you can&#39;t open your mouths and talk about it, or vote on it; because, seriously, what-the-fuck.&nbsp; I mean, I see Apocalypse and Superman 4 or whatever, yeah; I guess this is that.&nbsp; Change in truth, in available resources and technology have made something that was once absolutely unfathomable and impossible now ... easy as pie to do ... and absolutely unfathomable not to see done like, instantly.&nbsp; So, this is my ... &quot;maybe this is what Donald&#39;s wall is a metaphor for&quot; and like, I&#39;m reallocating some DOD/NORAD light to just doing it.&nbsp; For you, you know--because honestly, I know you&#39;d do the same thing for me, and your kids, and you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I made some art about .. well this idea, so &quot;the shape of his word is now ... oh, hi sword!&quot;&nbsp; Also we have a new &quot;eth&quot; which is the character of a cross coming out of a circle that&#39;s been brought up to speed on the new &quot;hilt&quot; and &quot;hisword&quot; that certainly gives new meaning to the &quot;sword in the rock.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s the &quot;seth.&quot;&nbsp; This three letter key, just to remind you all, appears in&nbsp;<i>Maveth</i>&nbsp;(which is Hebrew for&nbsp;<i>Thanatos</i>, oh, and in &quot;meth&quot; .. and &quot;beth&quot; which means &quot;house&quot;) and as what I see is the solution connecting Adamah and Planet, so it&#39;s like, pearl of wisdom, &quot;adam&#39;s name (i mean all nations) and how.&quot;&nbsp; the&nbsp;<i>Planseth</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the &quot;software of the road&quot; thing, which, that&#39;s &quot;sword&quot; expanded; I have lots of ideas about stuff I&#39;d like to do--and I think we&#39;ll probably all be very happy eventually that we opened up our heads and allowed for ... magic to make us smarter and instantly learn things, and I don&#39;t know, probably have a whole entire tab ort something on the &quot;appstore for our brains&quot; dedicated to the absolute latest and best virtual euphoria.&nbsp; This is the same kind of ... interface .. that we need to ever hold any kind of &quot;subconscious&quot; vote or have a running &quot;beat of the nation&quot; or whatever--like a scoreboard showing what the popular opinion is on some kind of hot topic like &quot;should we try to kill Adam and risk all dying?&quot; its also the same kind of interface that the government would need to like, stop people from pulling triggers aimed at children, and probably also come up with some sort of automagical workflow on what special kind of fluoride-ish (lol, fl you or i IDE) or ... risperdol-ish stuff that person needs to lack that kind of desire in the future.&nbsp; I mean that would be one way to go about dealing with &quot;pre-crime&quot; and magically disappearing jails at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know you probably don&#39;t see that stuff happening so quick in your minds, or in your ... past memories or whatever the hell is keeping you quite--but I can guarantee you that it will happen faster, with more intelligent guidance, and way better implementation than a single boy can come up with while he dreams about holodeck-leasure-suit-larry and you all don&#39;t say a word about &quot;being in Heaven&quot; or seeing God has basically outlined the whole thing to make the transition from Tartarus to ... &quot;not evil land&quot; as quick and painless as possible... in every word.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;d also like to see .. in this same sort of &quot;psuedo&quot;-as-a-service from the sky kind of package, a communications (and probably transportation) API to let us communicate with people and places &quot;not here&quot; without them having to uh, you know, take over your body through demonic possession and type a few questions to me on Twitter (which is the feeling I got, by the way ... in fact, that&#39;s the feeling I get whenever I talk to anyone about anything other than Donald Trump or drugs).&nbsp; I feel like we&#39;ve been plunged into backwards-and-crazy-universe where possession and calling people &quot;clothing&quot; has become like the ... defacto-standard-only-way-to-<wbr>be because well, it looks like it was always that way and meant to be that way; and we&#39;re in this place ... it&#39;s called America .. with this like huge debacle over self-determination and free will and what it means to be a slave, and uh, apparently this is &quot;his plan.&quot;&nbsp; So I&#39;m pretty sure the end result is we uh, you know, don&#39;t make each other total or partial slave-puppets and we see it&#39;s a very silly &quot;set up&quot; ... I mean, you&#39;re all acting very silly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</wbr></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway I see the whole thing as a planned &quot;liberation&quot; from xcaliber-ation to like, America and Stargate&#39;s goa-uldish take on Fallen and the idea that we&#39;re actually the source of Heaven and of freedom and that we certainly are not ants, or apes or ... well, that slavery and the puppeteering of living human beings is the kind of thing we should associate with Holocosts and Hitler not with America and uh, you.</p>
