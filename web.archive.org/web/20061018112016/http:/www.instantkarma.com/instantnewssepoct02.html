        <p><font face="Verdana" size="1">John Lennon's killer was denied parole
        for a second time, state officials said Wednesday.<br>
        <br>
        Releasing Mark David Chapman after 22 years in prison would &quot;deprecate
        the seriousness'' of the crime, the parole board said in a statement
        released Wednesday morning. The board said Chapman had &quot;acceptable''
        behavior in prison but that didn't guarantee he wouldn't pose a threat
        to society.<br>
        <br>
        At his first parole hearing two years ago, Chapman said he did not
        deserve to go free. He will be up for parole again in 2004.<br>
        <br>
        Chapman, 47, is serving 20 years to life for shooting Lennon outside his
        Manhattan apartment in 1980 as the former Beatle returned from a
        late-night recording session.<br>
        <br>
        Transcripts of the latest hearing were not immediately available. At his
        parole hearing two years ago, Chapman said: ``I believe once you take a
        person's life, there's no way you can make up for that. Period.''<br>
        <br>
        Chapman lives in a housing unit separate from the general population and
        works as a clerk in prison, said James Flateau, spokesman for the state
        Department of Correctional Services. He was involved in three ``minor
        incidents'' between 1989 and 1994 for delaying an inmate count and
        refusing to follow an order, but nothing since 1994, Flateau said.<br>

        MIND GAMES TO BE REISSUED...NOVEMBER 5<br>

        Remastered and Featuring Three Bonus Tracks</i><br>
        <br>
        Capitol Records News Release:<br>
        <br>
        Mind Games, John Lennon's seminal 1973 solo album, has been remixed,
        remastered and augmented by three bonus tracks, and will be reissued by
        Capitol Records on November 5, 2002.<br>
        <br>
        The original album is complemented by three previously unreleased tracks
        - an early version of &quot;Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)&quot; with alternate
        lyrics, a home version of &quot;Bring On The Lucie (Freda Peeple)&quot;
        and an alternate version of &quot;Meat City.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        In the tradition of Capitol's recent Lennon reissues (Imagine, Double
        Fantasy, Plastic Ono Band and Milk and Honey), Mind Games utilizes
        original cover art, but features new deluxe<br>
        packaging. The 32-page booklet includes many previously unseen John
        Lennon drawings, photographs and memorabilia from the era, plus full
        song lyrics.<br>
        <br>
        The follow-up to 1972's heavily politicized Some Time In New York City,
        Mind Games was recorded at New York's Record Plant in August 1973, and
        released in November of that year. At the time, John was in the middle
        of his battle with Immigration to stay in the U.S., the Watergate
        scandal was making headlines and a global recession was underway.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;On 'Mind Games,' for the first time, Lennon has begun to mix his
        older, spiritual and religious yearnings with his political
        convictions,&quot; noted critic Dave Marsh upon its release.<br>
        (A yellowed clipping of his review is reproduced in the CD booklet.)<br>
        <br>
        Just before recording the album, John and Yoko had moved into the Dakota
        in New York. That same month had seen them reveal their image of Nutopia,
        a concept explored on<br>
        the album sleeve for Mind Games and on the track &quot;Nutopian
        International Anthem,&quot; a few seconds of silence. In their
        Declaration of Nutopia (issued on April 1st of 1973 and<br>
        reproduced in the new packaging), John and Yoko described it as a
        conceptual country - one with &quot;no land, no boundaries, no
        passports, only people.no laws other than cosmic.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Mind Games was remixed at Abbey Road Studios, and was produced by Yoko
        Ono, from the original production by John Lennon.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;When considering this program of reissues, I kept thinking how
        John would have been thrilled by the possibilities offered by current
        recording technology,&quot; said Yoko. &quot;Thus,<br>
        along with the great team at Abbey Road, I was happy to ensure that
        these classic records could fully benefit from the improved mixing and
        mastering facilities available to us now.&quot;<br>

        &quot;permanently and perpetually enjoined from divulging, exploiting,
        or publicizing, commercially or otherwise, in any manner or medium, now
        and hereafter devised whatsoever, any information, facts, anecdotes, or

        you and John.&nbsp; These items include diaries, documents and
        more.&nbsp; I wrote things about you and your family in my book and

        SETTLEMENT!&nbsp; SEAMAN LOSES PHOTO RIGHTS -<br>
        APOLOGIZES TO YOKO, JOHN AND SEAN<br>

        to Court TV (see link above) Yoko reached a settlement today (Friday,
        September 27) with Fred Seaman over his use of hundreds of private
        family photos, ending a dispute that had stretched across two decades.<br>
        <br>
        As part of the settlement, former assistant Seaman issued a public
        apology to Yoko, the late Beatle and their son Sean, lawyers for both
        sides announced.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I offer no excuses for my conduct and ask only that you can find
        it in your heart to forgive me,&quot; Seaman said in a statement read in
        court by Yoko's attorney.<br>
        <br>
        Yoko had sued over the rights to 374 photos Seaman took of Lennon's
        family, many in the months before he was shot to death by a deranged
        fan, and closing arguments in the trial had been expected today.<br>
        <br>
        The settlement ended the trial and requires Seaman to surrender all
        rights to the photos. Seaman must also return any Lennon-related items
        still in his possession within 10 days. He admitted he had exploited the
        Lennon legacy for personal profit.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;After more than 20 years, it's time to ask for forgiveness for my
        actions,&quot; Seaman said. &quot;I now realize how much pain and
        embarrassment I have caused.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        In her lawsuit, Ono alleged that Seaman violated the agreement by
        publishing a memoir titled &quot;The Last Days of John Lennon: A
        Personal Memoir.&quot; She also claimed he profited by stealing Lennon
        mementos and selling them to collectors.</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><br>
        <br>
        Seaman's case had been dealt a major blow yesterday when the judge ruled
        that he had, indeed, violated a confidentiality agreement he'd signed
        when first employed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and U.S. District Judge
        Leonard Sand also ruled that Seaman was not an independent contractor
        when he worked for the Lenonos from 1979 to 1981.<br>

        &quot;Then it was very clear what was going on.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        According to Rosen, Seaman said he was &quot;carrying out a sacred
        mission on behalf of John Lennon&quot; when he ferreted away the late
        Beatle's materials at Rosen's house. When he wanted the items back in
        1982, he sent Rosen on a vacation sponsored by a backer for their book,
        then burgled his house. The incident marked an abrupt turn in the
        relationship between the two men, who had been friends since their days
        at the City College of New York newspaper in the early 1970s.<br>
        <br>
        Seaman later admitted to Rosen that he had sacked his house.
        &quot;[Seaman] said he did it, what was I going to do about it?&quot;
        Rosen testified. &quot;He inquired if I was going to sell my body on the
        street or commit suicide. I went into a state of shock.&quot;<br>

        From the Scotsman website:</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><i><br>
        <br>
        </i>James Doherty reported that Sean Lennon confessed he could barely
        remember his father, who was killed when Sean was just five.&nbsp; Sean
        spoke after watching a family video played at Manhattan's Federal Court
        in his mother, Yoko Ono's civil action against former aide, Fred Seaman.<br>
        <br>
        Sean said, &quot;There are a few memories, but they are fading, and believe
          it or not there is very little film footage of me with my father.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;He added: 'It was weird to watch, but also nice. I have seen some
          clips of it in a documentary about my parents last summer, but that
          was it.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;'I felt very stressed-out but I didn’t get upset, probably because
          I was in a courtroom. But it was also good. My memories of my father
          are fading and watching this bought it all back.'&quot;<br>
          <br>
        Sean Lennon was in court to support his mother who is suing Seaman, who she
          claims profited from the theft of hundreds of personal items from the
          Dakota apartment where the family lived in New York.<br>
          <br>
        Referring to the video, Sean said: &quot;I was so cute, I don’t
          know
          what happened afterwards.&quot;<br>

        SEAMAN ADMITS HE BROKE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT<br>
        <br>
        (Entered September 25, 2002)<br>
        <br>
        </b>Fred Seaman admitted in court today that </font><font face="Verdana" size="1">he
        planned to write a book about his former employer despite signing a
        confidentiality pact with John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono.<br>
        Yoko, who is suing Seaman in Manhattan federal court, accused him of
        stealing personal articles and memorabilia and selling them after John
        Lennon was fatally shot outside his New York City apartment on December
        8, 1980.<br>
        <br>
        On the witness stand, Seaman, who went to work for John just a year
        before his death, described signing the confidentiality pact and then
        hiding the plans for his book from the former Beatle.</font></p>

            <tr>
              <td width="63%"><font face="Verdana" size="1">Yoko testified this
                week in federal court against former personal assistant and
                Lennon gofer, Fred Seaman.&nbsp; She told the court that Seaman
                had been sworn to secrecy about her life with John Lennon.&nbsp;
                After the birth of the couple's only son, Sean, in 1975, the
                Lennons &quot;decided we wanted to keep our private life very
                private.&quot; Seaman was reminded &quot;that it was very
                important that he not give out any information about our
                whereabouts.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Yoko sued Seaman in 1999, alleging he violated a confidentiality
                agreement by publishing family photos of the Lennons in a
                book.&nbsp; She also claims he profited by stealing mementos and
                selling them to collectors, charges Seaman denies, but which has
                been confirmed in court by memorabilia dealer Gary Zimet.&nbsp;
                He testified that in 1994 he agreed to buy nine Lennon documents
                from Seaman, making the last of $64,500 in payments in
                January 1995. He said he bought two more letters written by
                Lennon for another $10,000 in 1997.&nbsp; Zimet said one item he
                bought from Seaman -- a draft of a harshly critical letter to
                fellow-Beatle Paul McCartney -- had sold for $90,500 at auction.<br>
                <br>
                The lawsuit against Seaman</font> &quot;<font face="Verdana" size="1">is
                about how John and Yoko put their trust in Mr. Seaman's hands,
                and how he betrayed that trust,&quot; Ono's attorney, Paul
                LiCalsi, said in his opening statement.&nbsp; Yoko is demanding
                that Seaman surrender rights to 374 photos he took of Lennon and
                turn over about $75,000 from the sale of Lennon's manuscripts
                and revealing letters.<br>
                <br>
                Seaman's lawyer, Glenn Wolther, characterized Yoko's lawsuit as
                a cynical bid to corner the market on the legacy of Lennon,
                &quot;one of the largest media icons of the 20th century.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Yoko dismissed Seaman in 1981, with severance pay, after seeing
                him wearing her husband's clothing.&nbsp; At the time, she was
                unaware that he had been looting Lennon's files. In 1983, Seaman
                pleaded guilty to second-degree larceny for stealing John
                Lennon's diaries; he was sentenced to five years' probation and
                ordered to return the property.<br>
                <br>
                Yoko's lawyer said, &quot;When he claimed he'd give everything
                back, he lied.&quot;</font></td>
