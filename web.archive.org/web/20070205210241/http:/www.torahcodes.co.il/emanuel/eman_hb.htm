<font size="4"><a name="INTRO">Introduction:</a><br>

</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their <i>Statistical 
Science</i> paper <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE1">[1]</a>, WRR presented statistical 
evidence for the existence of a hidden code in Genesis. Clearly, if their 
work was unbiased, such a proof indeed exists. Therefore, in their response 
in the same journal <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE2">[2]</a>, MBBK tried to prove their 
thesis that WRR's experiment was successful due to "tuning" 
of the data, especially of the names and appellations which they had used. 
In Sec. 10 (pgs. 163-164), MBBK report on "the most important class 
of experiments" they conducted to do this. We quote:<br>

<br>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>"Our own rabbis experiments.<br>

</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps the most important class of experiments we have conducted
are repetitions of the famous rabbis experiment. For this purpose, we 
engaged Simcha Emanuel, a specialist in rabbinical history at Tel-Aviv 
University, as an independent consultant.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the first experiment, Emanuel was informed which 32 rabbis appeared
on WRR's second list and asked to prepare names and appellations for each
of them. He had not seen WRR's lists and was asked not to consult them, 
nor was he given any explicit guidance concerning which types of appellations 
to include and how to spell them. Rather, he was asked to use his own 
professional judgement to settle all issues. During his work he consulted 
a second historian, David Assaf of Tel-Aviv University. As well as writing 
names and appellations, Emanuel and Assaf commented on the accuracy of 
the dates given by Margaliot (1962) and corrected some of them (as had 
WRR).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result of this experiment was a list of names and appellations which
appears quite different from that of WRR. The least permutation rank of 
P1 _ 4 was 0.233.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The same exercise was then carried out with a list of rabbis that had
not been used before, namely those whose entries in Margaliot's encyclopedia 
occupy from 1 to 1.5 columns and for whom there is a date of birth or 
death mentioned (except for those incorrectly included by WRR in their 
second list). For these 26 rabbis, the least permutation rank of P1 _ 
4 was 0.404.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the above two experiments were completed, we carried out the following
re-enactment of WRR's second experiment.<br>

<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of rabbis 
was drawn from Margaliot's encyclopedia by applying WRR's criteria for 
their second list, while correcting the errors they made. Our list differed 
from WRR's in dropping two rabbis and including three others. One rabbi 
who fits the selection criteria could not be included because he appears 
incorrectly in WRR's first list.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emanuel was shown 
the spelling rules and table of appellations for WRR's first list as they 
first appeared in WRR (1986). He then compiled a parallel table of appellations 
for our list of 33 rabbis, attempting to follow the rules and practices 
of WRR's first list.<br>

3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mimic WRR's processing 
of dates for their first list, we used the dates given by Margaliot except 
in the cases where Emanuel either found an error or found an additional 
date. In some cases Emanuel regarded a date as uncertain, in which case 
we followed WRR's practice of leaving the date out. Overall, Emanuel changed 
more of Margaliot's dates than WRR did.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting list 
of word pairs was processed using WRR's permutation test.<br>

<br>

The result of applying WRR's permutation test was that the least permutation 
rank of P1 _ 4 was an uninteresting 0.254.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are some syntactic differences between Emanuel's list and WRR's
first list, namely that Emanuel was sparing in use of articles and sometimes 
used a one-letter abbreviation for "Rabbi". We pointed out these 
differences to Emanuel, who then made some changes to his list. Because 
of our intervention, the new list cannot be said to be as a priori as 
the original, but it is arguably closer to the practices of WRR's first 
list. The new list gives permutation ranks of 0.154, 0.054, 0.089, and 
0.017 for P1 _ 4, respectively. Applying the Bonferroni inequality as 
in WRR94, we have an overall significance level of 0.066.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This negative result is all the more conclusive if we realize that our
experiment had some clear biases towards WRR's experiment. The definition 
of the set of rabbis, the introduction of P3 and P4 (only P1 and P2 appeared 
with the first list) and, most importantly, the definition of the permutation 
test, were under WRR's control when they ran their second experiment and 
were merely copied by us. Thus, we were vulnerable to any systematic bias 
that existed in those decisions, as well as to the possibility that WRR 
knew some examples from their second list earlier than acknowledged. We 
can only partly compensate for these biases. Using only P1 and P2 changes 
the overall result to 0.108. Using the permutation test of Diaconis (discussed 
in Sections 3 and 4) rather than the test invented by WRR, the results 
are even worse: 0.647 using the average and 0.743 using the minimum.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We believe that these experiments clearly establish that the success
of WRR's experiment was primarily due to the choices made in compiling 
their lists and not to any genuine ELS phenomenon in Genesis. The data 
for the above three experiments can be found at McKay's web site (1999b)."
</td></tr>
</table>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To evaluate their claims, it is necessary to first examine their lists.
But, wonder of wonders, despite their reference to McKay's web site, MBBK 
only published the lists <i>more than six months</i> after their paper 
was first published on the same web site, and even that only after we 
demanded it. A perusal of the published lists reveals that:<br>

a) These are not <b>all</b> the lists. <br>

b) The lists contain some unclear and even puzzling matters. <br>

<br>

So we turned <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE3">[3]</a> to their expert, Dr Simcha Emanuel, 
for clarification. Dr Emanuel politely objected that he could give no 
information without the permission of those who ordered his services. 
We sent a fax <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE4">[4]</a> to Emanuel listing all our questions 
at that stage. We also questioned him on why he shouldn't answer us freely 
if MBBK referred to him as "an independent consultant" (see 
above quote). <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seven days later, Emanuel informed us <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE5">[5]</a> that
he could now answer. (We will deal with the answers themselves and their 
implications later). Upon telling him we had more questions, he replied 
that needed further permission. We again expressed our surprise at this. 
He explained that he had been hired privately, and not through the academy 
(we didn't understand this answer).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We describe all this not to criticize Dr Emanuel, who was most polite
and candid, but to show the difficulty in getting uncensored information. 
<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We thoroughly examined the material which included the lists publicized
by MBBK, the information received from Dr Emanuel during our conversations 
with him <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE3">[3]</a> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE5">[5]</a>-<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a>, 
and various excerpts where MBBK quoted their expert. All this made clear 
that their experiment was indeed important and instructive. We drew the 
following significant conclusions:<br>


<ul>

<li>There is statistical evidence of (to quote MBBK), a "genuine 
ELS phenomenon in Genesis".<br>

<li>What MBBK did concerning the list ascribed to Dr Emanuel and used 
for their main experiment appears to be a simple deception. (This is yet 
another example, among many others <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE9">[9]</a>-<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE13">[13]</a>, 
of practices which cast grave doubt on MBBK's integrity.)<br>

</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper, we will examine the following:<br>

Chapter I will discuss MBBK's procedures.  Chapter II will deal with 
statistical evidence for the codes which can be deduced from Dr Emanuel's 
work.  In Chapter III we will investigate the source of the differences 
between Emanuel's and Havlin's lists.<br>

<br>

</font>

<font size="5"><a name="CHAPI">Chapter I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;

The Masquerade of Scientific Research</a></font>

<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this chapter we will discover that MBBK's seemingly "independent 
experiment" was actually conducted by methods that seem like utter 
deception. MBBK's purpose was twofold: To create conditions which would 
lead to their experiment failing, and at the same time to conceal an important 
fact&#150;&#150;that in reality  Emanuel's <b>real </b>data indicates 
that WRR's success was due not to "cooking" of names and appellations 
(as MBBK claim), but to the presence of a genuine code (as we will show 
in chapter II).<br>

<br>

Note: In this chapter we will not criticize Dr Emanuel's data. The following 
discussion will treat his data as if it is correct. Also, we will use 
MBBK's terminology  "corrected dates", although we do not agree 
that this is necessarily true. <br>

<br>

<b>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<u><font size="4"><a name="GAMES">Games people play:</a></font><br>

</u><br>

<b>(A)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBBK ordered 
a number of lists from Dr Emanuel. Here we will discuss the three lists 
prepared as alternatives to Havlin's second list (L2). <br>

<br>

<b><u>List a: <br>

</u></b>This list was prepared for the 32 rabbis of L2 with no guidelines 
or protocol from MBBK. Emanuel "collected names as he found them 
mentioned in the literature" <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE6">[6]</a>. (This list 
was publicized by MBBK on the Internet, and is brought in our appendix). 
<br>

<br>

After conducting experiments on "list a", MBBK ordered appellations 
for a different list, "list b", consisting of 35 rabbis. <br>

<br>

<b><u>List b:<br>

</u></b>This list was prepared for 35 rabbis: the 32 original rabbis 
and three more. This time Emanuel was asked to examine Prof. Havlin's 
<i>first</i> list of names and appellations (L1), and the rules laid out 
in our first preprint ('86). Here too, no work protocol was established.<br>

<br>

<b><u>List c:<br>

</u></b>After Emanuel finished "list b", MBBK pointed out 
that he had ignored two obvious rules:<br>

1. He wrote "R." instead of "Rabbi".<br>

2. In many cases he didn't include appellations with<font> 
  א''ה </font>as a prefix, unlike Havlin who included them in 
L1. (For example, Rambam - <b>Ha'</b> Rambam).<br>

Emanuel sent a list of corrections to MBBK. He retained the corrected 
"list b" with its 35 rabbis. We will call it "list c"
. <br>

<br>

Now MBBK prepared <u>two lists of their own:<br>

<b>List b1:</u></b> Emanuel's "list b", from which MBBK <b>removed</b> 
two rabbis (no. 5 and no. 16), <b>without Emanuel's knowledge</b> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE6">[6]</a> 
<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE7">[7]</a>. <br>

<b><u>List c1:</u></b> Emanuel's "list c" which was "
treated" as above: the same two rabbis were removed <b>without Emanuel's 
knowledge</b> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE6">[6]</a> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE7">[7]</a>.  <br>

<br>

<font size="4">
MBBK report (as we quoted at the beginning of this paper, from point
#1 and onward) on the experiments of lists b1 and c1, as if those lists 
were purely Dr Emanuel's work. And they publicized "list c1"
 on the Internet in his name, without informing him of their changes</font>
 <font size="3"> ("list c1" is brought in the appendix). <br>
MBBK's reported results are thus based not on Dr Emanuel's 
lists, but on their own.<br>

<br>

Note: Bar-Hillel, Bar-Natan and McKay once did something like this before. 
Concerning the preparation of the list of names and appellations used 
in their experiment on <i>War and Peace,</i> they wrote in an article 
in <i>Galileo</i> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE14">[14]</a>: <b>"Dror Bar-Natan 
and Brendan McKay, assisted by Prof. Menachem Cohen from the Faculty of 
Jewish Studies of the Bar Ilan University, accepted this challenge&#133;
"</b> Since Bar-Natan and McKay have little mastery of the Rabbinical 
Bibliography needed for such an enterprise, the reader must reasonably 
presume that Prof. Cohen prepared the list. But in reality, Cohen neither 
assembled this list, nor did he even assist in its compilation. When I 
publicized this in <i>Galileo </i><a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE15">[15]</a>, they chose 
to respond <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE15">[15]</a> as follows:<br>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
 "Contrary to what may have been understood from our article, the 
list of names checked in <i>War and Peace</i> was not prepared with Prof. 
Cohen's help, it only underwent his evaluation in comparison to the Havlin 
list."</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
(Concerning this and additional related untruths, see our paper <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE13">[13]</a>.) <br>

<br>

<b>(B)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="4">Playing with Dates:</font><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MBBK, quoted earlier, say that Dr Emanuel also prepared an alternative
list of dates. They say (at the end of the second paragraph):<br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"Emanuel and Assaf commented on the accuracy of the dates given 
by Margaliot (1962) and corrected some of them (as had WRR)."</td></tr>
</table>

They did this in the framework of the first stage, which included an 
experiment on "list a" and an experiment on "list d"
 which they describe as follows:<br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same exercise 
was then carried out with a list of rabbis that had not been used before, 
namely those whose entries in Margaliot's encyclopedia occupy from 1 to 
1.5 columns and for whom there is a date of birth or death mentioned (except 
for those incorrectly included by WRR in their second list). For these 
26 rabbis, the least permutation rank of P1 _ 4 was 0.404."</td></tr>
</table>
("List d" is included in our appendix).<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second stage, MBBK performed experiments on lists b1 and c1. 
Later in their paper (paragraph 3), MBBK describe what they did:<br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mimic WRR's 
processing of dates for their first list, we used the dates given by Margaliot 
except in the cases where Emanuel either found an error or found an additional 
date. In some cases Emanuel regarded a date as uncertain, in which case 
we followed WRR's practice of leaving the date out."</td></tr></table>

We see that only at this stage did they <b>add</b> dates or <b>omit</b> 
them (in cases of uncertainty). No such thing is mentioned for the first 
stage. <br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But MBBK publicized on the Internet
"list a" which was used
at the <i>first</i> stage, and it includes added dates and omits a "
spurious" date, although such dates were supposedly only added and 
omitted at the <i>second</i> stage! Indeed, "list d" which was 
tested <b>together</b> with "list a" in the first stage, had 
<b>no</b> spurious dates removed. <br>

<br>

It's also amazing that although MBBK write concerning the appellations: 
<br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"Emanuel was informed which 32 rabbis appeared on WRR's second 
list and asked to prepare names and appellations for each of them,"</td></tr>
</table>
they nowhere mention asking him to check or emend any dates. So we feel 
justified in asking:

<ul>

<li>What was written in their protocol? To check dates or not? <br>

<li>If their protocol included working with new dates, why didn't they 
ask Emanuel to prepare them?<br>

<li>How can the second stage protocol give an instruction "to mimic"
, if Emanuel was never told to check dates in order "to mimic"?
Emanuel couldn't have "mimicked" on his own initiative because
he didn't know that this was done by WRR for the first list, and MBBK 
couldn't have "mimicked" because it would have been forbidden 
to do so <i>a posteriori</i>! <br>

</ul>

We tried to clarify all this with Dr Emanuel. According to him <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a> 
the following picture emerges:<br>

<ol>

<li>    MBBK gave no written requests. There was only a verbal conversation.<br>

<li>    Even in this conversation, MBBK did not ask him to examine all 
the rabbis' dates. The sequence of events was as follows (we quote Dr 
Emanuel <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a>): "&#133;At a certain stage I understood 
that this matter interested them. Perhaps they asked it for one particular 
rabbi and then I went and did the same for them all&#133;"<br>

<li>    Concerning <i>when </i>the dates were emended: Dr Emanuel said 
that he thinks (but is not sure) that at the time "list b" was 
being prepared, he already had the great majority of the dates, perhaps 
all of them. "So I think". When we asked if it was done any 
earlier than "list b", he gave a vague reply that while working 
on the lists he understood that accuracy in the dates was important.<br>

</ol>

This disturbing procedure is even more puzzling if we remember that 
MBBK are manifestly in favor of a clear protocol: In Chance they even 
attacked WRR for lack of protocol <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE16">[16]</a>. <br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the manipulation uncovered in section (A), we surmise that 
MBBK specially created a situation where they would receive an emended 
list of dates, but never be obliged to use it because they had never officially 
ordered it. They also left themselves a third option: To use only correction(s) 
of the specific rabbi(s) for whom they had requested an examination of 
the date(s)&#133;<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, MBBK's appellation lists ("list b1" and "
list c1") and date emendation are "contaminated" and <b>useless 
</b>for any experiment. We are left with the default choice: To use Emanuel's 
appellations for the 32 original rabbis, and to use the original dates.<br>

<br>

<b>(C)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="4">Forgotten considerations:</font><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in chapter III sec. 1, we will report various questions we 
asked Dr Emanuel. In many cases Emanuel responded that he did not know 
what to answer. At the time he created the lists he was familiar with 
the material: Perhaps he had decided differently than Havlin, perhaps 
he had erred. He couldn't remember the considerations behind his decisions. 
 Nor did he wish to redo his work.  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe Dr Emanuel. These questions were asked a year after he prepared 
the lists, and it is plausible that he forgot details of a project that 
did not interest him <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a> and was done as a sideline. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we do have a complaint against MBBK. They concealed their lists 
before publicizing their paper in <i>Stat. Sc.</i> Afterwards they still 
refused to publicize them for some months, even though their paper claimed 
that they were available on Internet. By the time they finally publicized 
them (at our request) so much time had elapsed that their expert had already 
forgotten his considerations and could not submit them to public scrutiny. 
Those who maneuvered this sequence of events certainly had an interest 
in the subsequent result.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is very possible that all these disturbing activities could have 
been avoided if MBBK had agreed to a suggestion we publicized several 
times <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE15">[15]</a> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE17">[17]</a>&#150;&#150;
that an independent unbiased expert do everything in mutual agreement 
under controlled conditions. But MBBK has refused to do this for over 
two years, preferring their own creative methods. <br>

<br>

<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<a name="SMOKE"> <font size="4"><u>Smokescreens:</a></font><br>

</u><b><br>

(A)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBBK ascribe 
WRR's success to data "cooking". In MBBK's discussion of the 
various possibilities of "cooking" the data of the second list 
(L2), they mention three elements which could have enabled the hypothetical 
"cooking":<br>

a. Freedom in the choice of rabbis (pg. 155 of their paper);<br>

b. Freedom in choice of dates (pg. 155);<br>

c. Freedom in choice of appellations (page 156).<br>

<br>

MBBK consider <i>component c</i> as the main factor, and they emphasize 
this throughout their paper. For example, at the beginning of section 
7 (page 157): <br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
"In the previous sections we discussed some of the choices that 
were available to WRR when they did their experiment, and showed that 
the freedom provided just in the selection of appellations is sufficient 
to explain the strong result in WRR94 [i.e. the strong success of L2]."</td></tr>
</table> <br>

On the other hand, it can be easily shown that there was no exploitation 
of <i>components a and b</i> to improve WRR's result: Correcting the list 
of personalities according to MBBK's criterion [see later paragraph (B)2], 
and correction/addition/deletion of dates (according to their expert), 
would bring about an overall <b><u>improvement</u></b> of the original 
result for L2 [i.e. min(P1-P2), the only measure of success used for the 
original list] by a factor of 3.4.<br>

[Note: Even if we subscribe to MBBK'd dubious arguments and exclude 
Rabbi David Ganz from the list, there is still an <b>improvement</b> by 
a factor of 1.8, and even if we use the criteria MBBK just invented for 
including rabbis (see later paragraph (B)3), we still see an improvement, 
albeit  a smaller one.]<br>

<br>

<i>Therefore MBBK themselves, through their criteria of rabbis and their 
"corrected dates", enable us to prove that <b>our choices in 
the second list were disadvantageous.</b></i><br>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#AAAAAA">
We indicated elsewhere (<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE11">[11]</a>, chap. III) that 
MBBK of necessity had to create the impression that <u>all three</u> components 
were essential, because <u>they themselves</u> needed all three to "
cook" their <i>War and Peace</i> list.</td></tr></table>

The next section will reveal another important benefit achieved by that 
"impression": Concealment of the fact that an experiment based 
on Dr Emanuel's appellations for the 32 original rabbis actually <b>succeeded.<br>

</b> <br>

<b>(B)</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conventional 
scientific approach in researching a complex phenomenon is to isolate 
its components and examine them separately. Therefore, in a correct scientific 
work, <i>component c</i> ("the freedom in choice of appellations"
) should have been examined separately. This would apply even if we thought 
all three components were significant. How much more so considering that 
we know <i>component c</i> is the only important one (see paragraph (A)). 
[Note how Brendan McKay describes in his letter of July '97 to TCODE (an Internet
discussion group on Torah Codes) members, the preparation of his list for "War
and Peace":
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"Using the <u>same</u> rabbis and the <u>same</u> dates, it is possible to
make up an alternative set of appellations...". (Emphasis mine).</td></tr></table>
By the way, this protocol was never fulfilled (see <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE13">[13]</a>).]

<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But MBBK ignored this elementary scientific principle, preferring to 
deal with all factors at once. They have an excuse. They wanted to 
"mimic" WRR's work methods. But we will see that they did no 
"mimicry" of WRR, nor any scientific investigation. Instead they deliberately 
"cooked" data to make their experiment seem a failure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because they ordered appellations of 35 rabbis from Dr Emanuel, their 
only honest choice was to use all 35 for their experiment. On the other 
hand, there would have been no logic in that, since the 35 rabbis were 
selected according to contradicting criteria. They could either have used 
WRR's original 32 rabbis, or their own list of rabbis (prepared according 
to their criterion). But neither list would have been the list of 35 rabbis 
ordered by them! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore it seems that they <u>never</u> intended to include <i>all</i> 
35 rabbis in their experiment. On the contrary, it appears that they intended 
to choose a subset of rabbis for their experiment tailored to achieve 
the desired result. They had two options in choosing such a subset:<br>

<br>

(1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The default choice 
would have been to use all the 32 original rabbis. Scientifically, this 
is the best choice, because it isolates <i>element c</i> as explained 
above.<br>

(2).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take those rabbis 
who satisfy their criterion for inclusion in the list. [At least this 
choice had some excuse (mimicry&#133;)].<br>

<br>

We know their criterion to include rabbis in L2 from a letter of 27 
Nov. '96 <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE18">[18]</a>: According to the examples brought 
there, their criterion is text size (excluding headings) of a column and 
a half, i.e. a column and seventeen lines. This criterion is constantly 
reiterated over the years in various versions of McKay and Bar-Natan's 
article, "ELSs in Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>" <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE19">[19]</a>. 
 They write there: <br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"We remove Rabbi II-20, Rabbi Yosef Teomim. His entry in <i>Enc. 
Margalioth</i> has less than 1.5 columns, contrary to the selection criteria 
of WRR".</td></tr></table>

Actually, the entry for R. Yosef Teomim in Encyclopedia Margaliot, is 
a column and 16 lines (excluding headings), or a column and 17 lines including 
headings.<br>

<br>

However, they surprisingly chose a <i>third</i> option.<br>

(3). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a list 
"corrected" according to a <i>new</i> criterion of including 
rabbis. <br>

This time they included the heading in the number of lines [thus including, 
amongst others, R. Yosef Teomim, and R. Yehosef Hanagid of whom they explicitly 
wrote (in the above sources) that they failed to meet the 1.5 column criterion].<br>

<br>

Until now we discussed the options for creating a subset out of the 
set of 35 rabbis. But they still had room to maneuver with the dates. 
They could test the appellations of the chosen rabbis:<br>

(4).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the original 
dates. <br>

(5).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the dates 
of their expert. <br>

(6).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the original 
dates, correcting only those that they requested. <br>

<br>

Therefore, even after they decided to ignore the natural choice (option 
1), they still had 2x3 <i>a posteriori</i> choices. Since we have no data 
for option (6), we can calculate only the four following results:<br>

(a).  (2)+(4):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0048, therefore the overall 
significance is r=0.019,<br>

(b).  (2)+(5):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0117, therefore the overall 
significance is r=0.047,<br>

(c).  (3)+(4):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0052, therefore the overall 
significance is r=0.021,<br>

(d).  (3)+(5):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0163, therefore the overall 
significance is  r=0.065.<br>

But MBBK had yet another choice. According to option (2) or (3), they 
should have included R. David Ganz in the list. But they did not. They 
explain that R. David Ganz was already included in the first list. But 
there is no doubt that had they wanted to include him they could have 
argued the exact opposite: That he precisely meets the criterion to be 
included in the list. Let's examine the following four results:<br>

(e).  (a) + R. David Ganz:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0014, therefore the 
overall significance is r=0.0056,<br>

(f).   (b) + R. David Ganz:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0038, therefore the 
overall significance is r=0.015,<br>

(g).  (c) + R. David Ganz:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0015, therefore the 
overall significance is r=0.0062,<br>

(h).  (d) + R. David Ganz:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r4=0.0058, therefore the 
overall significance is   t=0.0058.<br>

Not surprisingly MBBK chose option (d), which gives the worst significance. 
(Further discussion concerning the dates may be found in our paper <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE20">[20]</a>). <br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having "cooked" the results of their experiment, they could 
confidently announce: <br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"We believe that these experiments clearly establish that the success 
of WRR's experiment was primarily due to the choices made in compiling 
their lists and not to any genuine ELS phenomenon in Genesis."</td></tr></table>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now that we have seen what MBBK did, let's examine what they should 
have done. Let's return to the default choice: To take the 32 original 
rabbis [option (1) in the previous paragraph]. Scientifically, this is 
the <i>a priori</i> correct choice because it isolates <i>element c</i> 
("The freedom in choice of appellations"). As we have seen in 
this chapter it is also the only possible choice, since MBBK's data were 
<i>contaminated</i>. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will now check whether the list of names and appellations chosen 
by Dr Emanuel and intended to mimic the original list (L2), is really 
a failure in the original experiment's conditions. In other words, we 
will investigate what would have happened had WRR used Dr Emanuel's names 
and appellations in their experiment instead of those chosen by Prof. 
Havlin. Therefore, we will take <u>the same 32 rabbis who appeared in 
the original list, and the original dates</u>, while using the names and 
appellations prepared by Emanuel in his emended list, <i>"list c"
</i> (See chap. I sec. 1).<br>

<br>

<font size="4">
<a name="#RECONSTRUCTION"><u>A reconstruction of Dr Emanuel's <i>"
list c"</i>:</a></font><br>

</u><font size="3"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the names and appellations of <i>"list c"</i> are 
found in "list c1" which was publicized by MBBK. The first 30 
rabbis (of 33) are from the original list (L2) which consisted of 32 rabbis. 
For the remaining two Dr Emanuel prepared appellations. But MBBK omitted 
them without his knowledge and did not publicize them on the Internet. 
A conversation <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE7">[7]</a> with Emanuel helped us to deduce 
the missing appellations: <br>

For no. 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</font><font face="David"> לודגה  ןרהא  יבר ,ןרהא יבר </font><font><br>

For no. 16:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</font><font face="David"> שאיע  הדוהי ,שאיאע  הדוהי ,שאיע, שאיאע ,הדוהי יבר </font><font><br>

Thus we managed to reconstruct the whole <i>"list c"</i> of 
Dr Emanuel. <br>

<b><br>

2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a name="MEASURE"><font size="4"><u>Measurements and results:</font></a><br>

</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We created a sample, which has the same 32 Rabbis who appeared in the 
original experiment. Their names and appellations are taken from <i>"
list c"</i> of Emanuel, and the dates are the same as in the original 
experiment. All the expressions are 5-8 letters long, exactly as in the 
original experiment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This sample, which we will call EM3, has 102 "name-date" pairs 
which appear in Genesis as ELSs (L2 has 163). Omitting the standard appellations 
of the "Rabbi X" type, we get sample EM'3 which has only 63 
such pairs (L'2 has 126).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The measurements were made the same as in the original permutation test. 
Two statistics, r1 and r2, measure the whole sample EM3, and two statistics, 
r3 and r4, measure EM'3.<br>

<br>

<u>The results:</u><br>

For the same 999,999 permutations used in the original permutation test, 
we get:<br>

<center>r1=0.0032, r2=0.0026, r3=0.0045, r4=0.0009.<br>

</center>Therefore:<br>
<table width="50%" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td>The overall significance is:     r=4xr4=0.0036.</td></tr> 
</table>
<br>

<b></font><font size="4">3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<a name="MEANING"><u>The meaning of the result:</a><br>

</u><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font size="3">The result is undoubtedly significant, and proves 
that the phenomenon indicated by WRR indeed exists. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the other hand, the significance is far smaller than that of WRR's 
original experiment. Therefore, a question arises: Is this result consistent 
with the original result or not? <br>

<br>

<b></font><font size="4">(A)</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of each of the two experiments was obtained 
through r4. It appears that the difference in the values of r4 arises 
mainly because EM'3 has only 63 pairs, while L'2 has many more pairs, 
126. This simple fact sufficiently explains the gap in the results:<br>

<br>

(1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRR's final result 
in the original experiment came from accumulation of the <i>c(w,w')</i> 
values for the word pairs <i>(w,w')</i>. 
Therefore it can be anticipated that reducing the number of pairs would 
bring a drop in the significance of the remainder.  If we remove half 
the pairs, (even randomly), the new result would expectedly be (roughly) 
the square root of the original result. Therefore, a change from 126 pairs 
to 63 pairs could be expected to worsen the original result (which was 
0.0000007), a thousand fold.<br>

(2).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We performed the 
following experiment: <br>

(a) From L'2 we randomly chose a subgroup of appellations, so that 
the number of name-
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>date pairs created by these appellations would be exactly 63. Thus we got a sub-sample of the
original containing 32 rabbis and 63 name-date pairs.</td></tr></table> 
(b) We measured this sub-sample using statistic r4. <br>
(c) We repeated steps (a)-(b) 500 times.<br>
(d) We counted how many times the statistic r4 received a value greater than 0.0009 (the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of EM'3).<br>

<br>
<u>The result of the experiment</u>: <br>

In 120 cases out of 500, r4 was bigger than 0.0009.<br>

<u><br>
Conclusion</u>: Even though the value of r4 for L'2 was as low as 0.0000007, 
the probability that a sub-sample of 63 pairs will have r4 bigger than 
0.0009 is quite high: <br>

<b><center>p=0.24.<br>

</center></b>Therefore, the result obtained for EM'3, which has only 
63 pairs, is consistent with WRR's original result for L'2, which has 
126 pairs. <br>

<br>

<b></font><font size="4">(B)</b></font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quote at the beginning of this paper, 
MBBK also cast aspersions on the measuring procedure. Because their objections 
relate to the original experiment this is not the place to discuss them. 
Elsewhere <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE9">[9]</a> <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE10">[10]</a> we explain 
why these assertions are fallacious, and why their suggestion to measure 
with the "arithmetic average" is mistaken. Concerning measuring 
with "minimum", it turns out that the results for EM3 are <br>
min(r1-r4)=0.0056,
which is consistent with the result obtained for L2 using this method.<br>

<br>

<b>(C)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we examine 
how many appellations (appearing as ELSs in Genesis) Emanuel <u>added</u> 
as compared to L'2, it turns out to be <b><u>four</u></b> appellations 
and one exchange of spelling.  <b><u>That's all!</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>If we add Emanuel's additions to L2, and change his one spelling, 
we get a list that we will call L2EM3. It turns out that for min(P1-P2) 
(the only criterion for success when L2 was prepared), we receive <b><u>the 
same result</u></b> for L2EM3 as for L2. [It is interesting to note that 
in the permutation test on L2EM3 the result <u>improves</u> fourfold!] 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This proves that the few appellations added by Emanuel onto L'2, were 
not omitted by Havlin with intent to improve the results: they were omitted 
for entirely different reasons.<br>

<br>
<table width="90%" border="1">

In the following chapter we will explain, among other things, <b>why</b> 
Dr Emanuel chose less appellations than Prof. Havlin. Here we will just 
mention, that using MBBK's "study of variations" to see whether 
the appellations chosen by Havlin and omitted by Emanuel were a result 
of "cooking" shows <b>no</b> such indication. (See <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE11">[11]</a>,

<a name="CHAP3"><font size="5">Chapter III.</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emanuel's list
</font>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We saw in the previous chapter, that Dr Emanuel's <i>"list c"
</i> constitute a basis for a proof to the validity of WRR's original 
experiment. Now let's examine <i>"list c"</i> itself. <br>

<br>

<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
<font size="4">
<a name="WHY"><u>Why did Emanuel choose less names and appellations 
than Havlin?</a></font> <br>

</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the previous chapter we explained that EM'3 (which was built from 
<i>"list c"</i>) has about half the number of "name-date"
 pairs as L'2. This is because the number of names and appellations (which 
have 5-8 letters and which have an ELS in Genesis) in EM'3 is 28, compared 
to the 52 names and appellations in L'2.<br>

<br>

Why did Emanuel choose less names and appellations than Havlin? <br>

<br>

<b>(A)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject 
of names and appellations is a field of research in itself (onomatology). 
To prepare a list like L2 requires a knowledge of Jewish history, especially 
Rabbinical bibliography, as well as linguistic expertise. Here are some 
facts about Prof. Havlin.<br>

<ul>

<li>For six years he was head of the Information Studies &amp; Bibliography 
Department at the Bar Ilan University. <br>

<li>In his field of expertise he published a book, dozens of biographies and
many articles.<br>

<li>He is the editor of <i>Alei Sefer</i>, a journal of Hebrew bibliography 
and booklore, since '84.<br>

<li>Names are certainly not his chief occupation, but he has devoted 
time and thought to this subject: In the bibliographies mentioned above 
(especially those he wrote for the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>), he indicated 
various names and appellations and commented on them. Concerning the theoretical 
side of the subject, he gave a lecture at the meeting of the Israeli Society 
of Genealogy (in whose meetings he participates.) <br>

</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dr Emanuel is presented by MBBK as an expert. He is indeed. He is a 
researcher at the Tel Aviv University, and his field of expertise is Jewish 
History (mainly medieval). He says <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE6">[6]</a>-<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a> 
that his chief interest is the history of rabbis and their place in Jewish 
History. But he does not regard himself as an expert in appellations, 
and this subject doesn't particularly interest him. He considers the work 
he did for MBBK "uninteresting" and has no interest in any more 
such work. He said that he finds it most uncomfortable working within 
the constraints of linguistic rules laid down in WRR's first preprint, 
and he is not used to spelling according to the <i>grammatical orthography</i>. 
<br>

<br>

Now, suppose two experts are requested to collect data of certain kind: 
<br>

<ul>

<li>Expert A is expert and interested in the requested data.<br>

<li>Expert B is neither particularly expert nor interested in this data.<br>

</ul>

Wouldn't expert A demonstrate more knowledge and thoroughness than expert 
B in doing the job? <br>

<br>

Therefore, is it a surprise that Havlin listed more names and appellations 
than Emanuel? <br>

<br>

<b>(B)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE6">[6]</a>-<a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a> Dr Emanuel about some of 
his decisions concerning names and appellations. <br>

<br>

 (1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked why he 
had omitted certain names and appellations (which Havlin included) which 
do not seem uncommon in Torah literature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dr Emanuel replied that he did not know what to answer. At the time 
he had thought about the matter: Perhaps he reached a different conclusion 
than Havlin, perhaps he erred. At present he could not reconstruct his 
considerations. And he did not wish to redo the work. <br>

<br>

(2).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While creating <i>"
list b"</i> (and <i>"list c"</i>), Emanuel omitted certain 
names and appellations which he had included in <i>"list a"</i>. 
This happened as a result of his examining L1 and the linguistic rules. 
In several cases we could not understand how his omissions derived from 
the rules, and we asked him to explain. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dr Emanuel replied that at this stage he could not explain. <br>

<br>

(3).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked him about 
certain inconsistencies in his decisions.<br>

Dr Emanuel replied that at this stage he did not know. Perhaps he erred, 
perhaps not. "If you like, write a critique. Say that I was inconsistent".<br>

<br>

(4).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We asked about 
deviations from the rules derivable from L1. <br>

Dr Emanuel could not explain this at present, due to the long time since 
he made his considerations. MBBK writes (in quote at the beginning of 
this paper) that after Dr Emanuel finished his list, it became clear that: 
<br>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>"There are some syntactic differences between Emanuel's list and 
WRR's first list, namely that Emanuel was sparing in use of articles and 
sometimes used a one-letter abbreviation for "Rabbi". We pointed 
out these differences to Emanuel, who then made some changes to his list."</td>
</tr></table>
<br>

In other words, according to MBBK, Emanuel failed to notice two elementary 
rules in writing appellations. Actually, he missed some more, but MBBK 
only drew his attention to the most obvious. We think there is a simple 
reason for this: They were worried that any Hebrew speaking person would 
easily notice that Emanuel <u>did not</u> work according to the rules 
derived from L1, and then their goal (to present his work as based on 
Havlin's rules) would not be achieved.<br>

<br>

(5).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked about a 
number of deviations from linguistic rules, pointing out the necessary 
emendations. <br>

He replied, "I think some of your spelling corrections are justified"
, and he added, "Well, now you'll have something to answer back with"
.<br>

<u>Comment:</u> Concerning the appellation "המלש  ינגמ" which he wrote as,
 "המלש  יניגמ" with an added letter, he thought that he had not erred, because there are bibliographic 
texts with his version. But we pointed out that those books consistently 
used "full spelling", including extra letters and not the <i>grammatical 
orthography</i>, and could not be relied on for spelling. <br>

<br>
<font size="4">
It should be emphasized, that Dr Emanuel was not asked by MBBK to prepare, 
and did not prepare, a list of rules derivable from L1. All his work was 
based on his intuitive impressions of L1. Under such conditions it is 
not surprising that he could not answer most of our queries.<br>
</font>
<br>

<u>In conclusion:<br>

</u>In light of all this, it is perfectly understandable why it is possible 
and even anticipated that EM'3 would include less names and appellations 
than L'2.<br>

<br>

<b>2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="4">
<a name="IMPORTANCE"><u>The importance of Dr Emanuel's <i>"list 
c"</i>:</a><br></font>

</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The importance of Dr Emanuel's <i>"list c"</i>, which is the 
basis of EM'3, is not because it is more correct and accurate than L2. 
On the contrary, it is certainly worse in those respects. The importance 
of Dr Emanuel's <i>"list c"</i> is in it's being completely 
<u>unbiased towards WRR</u>. Any possible bias was to MBBK's benefit:<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li>For example, because MBBK originally told Emanuel to create <i>"
List a"</i> with no instructions, rules or guidelines, he had bias 
towards his original list when he made <i>"list b"</i> and <i>"
list c"</i> (since a person favors his prior decisions, and tries 
to reconcile them to new circumstances).<br>

<li>We saw in chapter I sec. 1(B) that MBBK gave instructions relating 
the dates, through <i>"hints"</i>. Who knows how, and how often, 
such <i>"hints"</i> were given concerning appellations?<br>

</ul>
<font size="4">
<b>3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u><a name="CONCERNING">Concerning further lists:</a></u><br>
</font>
 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We would like to remark about two of Emanuel's lists <i>("list 
a"</i> and <i>"list d"</i>) which were tested in the first 
stage of MBBK's experiments.<br>

<ul>

<li>These lists can't be considered as mimicry of L2, because they lack 
the constraint imposed on L2: that it should be compatible with L1.<br>

<li>We think that MBBK's experiments have no statistical value. MBBK's 
interference in preparation of at least part of the data (see chapter 
I sec. 1), puts all their data under suspicion of <i>contamination</i>.<br>

</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But, beyond anything else, these lists do not constitute a replication 
of the original list. MBBK knows very well that we do not claim that the 
Genesis Code includes initials and abbreviations of names, unless they 
are usually <i>pronounced</i> (like regular names). We claim that the 
Code includes regular words, names and appellations. "Appellations"
 includes abbreviations, which are<i> pronounced</i> (like regular words 
and names i.e., NASA). This is not only evident from what is included 
in L1, but also clarified explicitly by Prof. Havlin <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE21">[21]</a>. 
But MBBK did not instruct Emanuel to include only appellations, so he 
included <i>many</i> examples which he admits <a href="eman_hb.htm#NOTE8">[8]</a> 
are <i>not</i> appellations but simple abbreviations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In other words, experiments are being done using lists consisting<i> 
mainly </i>of expressions which no one ever claimed would be encoded in 
Genesis. The results are then presented as refutation of the original 
claims! Meanwhile, the reader has no way of knowing what was actually 
included in their lists. Is there any greater deception than this!? <br>

For the purposes of this paper let this suffice.<br>

Note:  After publication of our paper, Dr Emanuel realised that the<br>

appellation  ריאי  תווח is properly spelt  ריאי  תוח.  Correcting the<br>

error makes hardly any difference to the results of the experiment.<br>

The overall significance levels given in our paper as 0.066 and     
<br>

0.108 are still true.<br>
