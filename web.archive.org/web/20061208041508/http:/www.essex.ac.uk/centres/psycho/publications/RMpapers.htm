</p>

<p align="justify">In this paper, I examine the role C. G. Jung&#146;s (1875-1961) theory of synchronicity
played in his attempt to come to a satisfactory understanding of the relationship between
religion and science. First, I briefly explain the theory of synchronicity. Then, I sketch
Jung&#146;s lifelong preoccupation with the relationship between religion and science and
note some of its implications for his general psychological theory. Jung&#146;s emphasis
in this theory on the primacy of psychic reality provided a ground on which religious
(spiritual) imagery and scientific (material) imagery could interact. However, it also
left him open to the charge that he was reducing spiritual and material phenomena to
psychic phenomena. Next, I show the influence of Jung&#146;s understanding of religion and
science on his theory of synchronicity. After that, I note some influences that the theory
of synchronicity, reflexively, had on Jung&#146;s understanding of religion and science.
With the theory of synchronicity, Jung achieves even closer interaction between the
domains of religion and science and in a manner that is less dependent on the notion of
psychic reality. In the last main section, I suggest how the theory of synchronicity
supports some of the more spiritual emphases within analytical psychology. I conclude by
noting a more general implication of this overall discussion for the status of depth
psychology in relation to religion and science.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">JUNG&#146;S THEORY OF SYNCHRONICITY</p>

<p align="justify">Jung was in his mid seventies before he formally set down his thoughts about
synchronicity&#151;although he had been thinking about and occasionally alluding to the
phenomenon for almost thirty years (Jung, 1952b, par. 816; 1963, p. 342). He defined
synchronicity in a variety of ways. Most succinctly, he defined it as &#145;meaningful
coincidence&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 827), as &#145;acausal parallelism&#146; (Jung, 1963,
p. 342), or as &#145;an acausal connecting principle&#146; (Jung, 1952b). More fully, he
defined it as &#145;the simultaneous occurrence of a certain psychic state with one or
more external events which appear as meaningful parallels to the momentary subjective
state&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 850). What he means by these definitions is most easily
conveyed by an example. Jung&#146;s best-known account of a synchronistic experience
concerns a young woman patient whose excellent but excessive intellectuality made her
&#145;psychologically inaccessible&#146;, closed off from a &#145;more human
understanding&#146;. Unable to make headway in the analysis, Jung reports that he had to
confine himself to &#145;the hope that something unexpected would turn up, something that
would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself&#146;. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her
    flow of rhetoric. She had had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had
    given her a golden scarab&#151;a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me
    this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and
    saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane in
    the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the
    window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid
    beetle, or common rose-chafer (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>), whose gold-green colour most nearly
    resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words,
    &#145;Here is your scarab.&#146; This experience punctured the desired hole in her
    rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be
    continued with satisfactory results.</p>
    <p align="justify">(Jung, 1951b, par. 982)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">In this example, the <i>psychic state</i> is indicated by the patient&#146;s decision
to tell Jung her dream of being given a scarab. The <i>parallel external event</i> is the
appearance and behaviour of the real scarab. Neither of these events discernibly or
plausibly caused the other by any normal means, so their relationship is <i>acausal</i>.
Nevertheless, the events parallel each other in such unlikely detail that one cannot
escape the impression that they are indeed <i>connected</i>, albeit acausally. Moreover,
this acausal connection of events both is symbolically informative (as we shall see) and
has a deeply emotive and transforming impact on the patient and in these senses is clearly
<i>meaningful</i>. (Jung&#146;s requirement that the parallel events be <i>simultaneous</i>
is more problematic. For present purposes, it is sufficient to know that Jung does also
allow for paralleling between events that are not simultaneous. Thus, the patient&#146;s
dream, rather than her decision to tell the dream, preceded the actual appearance of the
scarab by several hours. Yet, Jung would certainly have considered the coincidence between
the dream and the actual appearance synchronistic even if the patient had not decided to
tell the dream at just that moment.)</p>

<p align="justify">Jung attempts to account for synchronistic events primarily in terms of his concept of <i>archetypes</i>.
For this purpose, he highlights the nature of archetypes as &#145;formal factors
responsible for the organisation of unconscious psychic processes: they are &quot;patterns
of behaviour.&quot; At the same time they have a &quot;specific charge&quot; and develop
numinous effects which express themselves as <i>affects</i>&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 841).
They &#145;constitute the structure&#146; not of the personal but &#145;of the <i>collective
unconscious</i> &#133; a psyche that is identical in all individuals&#146; (Jung, 1952b,
par. 840; emphasis added). Also relevant is that they typically express themselves in the
form of <i>symbolic images</i> (Jung, 1952b, par. 845). Jung considered that synchronistic
events tend to occur in situations in which an archetype is active or
&#145;constellated&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 847). Such constellation of archetypes in the
life of a person is governed by the process of <i>individuation</i>&#151;the inherent
drive of the psyche towards increased wholeness and self-realisation. Individuation in
turn proceeds through the dynamic of <i>compensation</i>, whereby any one-sidedness in a
person&#146;s conscious attitude is balanced by contents emerging from the unconscious
which, if successfully integrated, contribute to a state of greater psychic wholeness.
Relating these psychological dynamics to the example, Jung suggests that it has &#145;an
archetypal foundation&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 845) and, more specifically, that it was
the archetype of rebirth that was constellated. He writes that &#145;Any essential change
of attitude signifies a psychic renewal which is usually accompanied by symbols of rebirth
in the patient&#146;s dreams and fantasies. The scarab is a classic example of a rebirth
symbol&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 845). The emotional charge or numinosity of the archetype
is evident from its having &#145;broke[n] the ice of [the patient&#146;s] intellectual
resistance&#146;. The compensatory nature of the experience is also clear: her one-sided
rationalism and psychological stasis were balanced by an event that both in its symbolism
and in its action expressed the power of the irrational and the possibility of renewal.
Finally, that all of this promoted the patient&#146;s individuation is implied by
Jung&#146;s statement that &#145;The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory
results&#146;.</p>

<p align="justify">Jung mentions several reasons why the theory of synchronicity was important to him. He
wished to make sense of the numerous meaningful coincidences he had experienced
personally, observed in others, or encountered in the course of his research into the
history of symbols. He felt that synchronicity opens up &#145;a very obscure field which
is philosophically of the greatest importance&#146;. Again, he had become convinced as to
&#145;how much these inner experiences meant&#146; to his patients (Jung, 1952b, par.
816). In what follows, I shall argue that the theory of synchronicity was also important
to Jung because of the role it played, albeit implicitly, in his attempt to come to a
satisfactory understanding of the relationship between religion and science.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">JUNG AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE</p>

<p align="justify">In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, when the depth psychological
theories were being developed, much of the most vocal discussion of the relationship
between religion and science presented them as irreconcilable and engaged in an epic
battle for intellectual and spiritual hegemony. For example, in
1875, the year of Jung&#146;s birth, J. W. Draper published a book entitled <i>History of
the conflict between religion and science</i>. Twenty years later, in 1895, appeared A. D.
White&#146;s volume <i>A history of the warfare of science with theology in Christendom</i>.
Present-day discussions tend to recognise more nuances. In what follows, I shall make use
of the contemporary writer Ian Barbour&#146;s recognition of four main categories of
interaction between religion and science (Barbour, 1998, pp. 77-105). First is <i>conflict</i>,
in which religion and science provide competing and mutually exclusive explanations for
the same phenomena (e.g., Bible-belt creationist accounts versus Neo-Darwinian
evolutionary accounts of the origin of human life). Second is <i>independence</i>, in
which religion and science either account for different phenomena (e.g., material and
spiritual) or provide different kinds of account for the same phenomena (e.g., science
explains the mechanisms, religion explains the purpose); because there is no direct
competition between them, these accounts are, at least in principle, compatible. Third is <i>dialogue</i>,
in which religion and science, for all their differences, have sufficient areas of
overlapping interest to allow for a fruitful exchange of insights and ideas (e.g., Fritjof
Capra&#146;s [1977] highlighting of a shared concern with interconnectedness in some
Eastern religions and some theories of modern physics). Fourth and last is <i>integration</i>,
in which religion and science are capable, at least at certain points, of unification into
a single discourse (e.g., Teilhard de Chardin&#146;s [1959] weaving together of biological
and spiritual evolution).</p>

<p align="justify">Jung was preoccupied with the relationship between religion and science throughout his
life. In one of the chapters he himself wrote for <i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</i> he
recalls his youthful interest in both these areas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">The older I grew, the more frequently I was asked by my parents and others what I
    wanted to be. I had no clear notions on that score. My interests drew me in different
    directions. On the one hand I was powerfully attracted by science, with its truths based
    on facts; on the other hand I was fascinated by everything to do with comparative
    religion. In the sciences I was drawn principally to zoology, palaeontology, and geology;
    in the humanities to Greco-Roman, Egyptian, and prehistoric archaeology. At that time, of
    course, I did not realise how very much this choice of the most varied subjects
    corresponded to the nature of my inner dichotomy. What appealed to me in science were the
    concrete facts and their historical background, and in comparative religion the spiritual
    problems, into which philosophy also entered. In science I missed the factor of meaning;
    and in religion, that of empiricism.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">(Jung, 1963, p. 79)</p>

<p align="justify">Jung&#146;s reference here to his &#145;inner dichotomy&#146;&#151;between one part of
him oriented towards mystery and inner experience and another part oriented towards
rationalism and social adaptation&#151;testifies to the personal dimension of his struggle
with religion and science. The problem of their relationship was made even more acute for
Jung when he witnessed his father, a Protestant pastor, undergoing a crisis of faith
largely precipitated by the ascendancy of materialistic science. Writes Jung:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">My father was obviously under the impression that psychiatrists had discovered
    something in the brain which proved that in the place where mind should have been there
    was only matter, and nothing &#145;spiritual&#146;. This was borne out by his admonitions
    that if I studied medicine I should in Heaven&#146;s name not become a materialist.</p>
    <p align="justify">(Jung, 1963, p. 98)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">I would not want to suggest that personal factors alone were responsible for
Jung&#146;s interest in the relationship between religion and science. A fuller
contextualisation would have to consider a whole range of other contributory
influences&#151;intellectual, professional, social, geographical, economic, and political.
I have focused on the personal factors because these most vividly convey the urgency of
the problem presented to Jung by the dominant narrative of <i>conflict</i> between
religion and science. As someone who could count numerous clergymen among his relatives
and ancestors and who himself had a strong disposition towards personal religious
experience, Jung would likely have experienced materialistic science not just as a threat
to religion but as a threat to his own identity.</p>

<p align="justify">A scan of Jung&#146;s work at any stage in his long career shows that this early
problem never left him. It is a dominant theme in the five lectures he delivered as a
medical student to his fraternity the Zofingia Society (Jung, 1896-99). It is implicit in
his decision to base his doctoral dissertation on a case study of a spirit medium (Jung,
1902; Charet, 1993). It was one of the main issues that led to his parting of ways with
Freud and psychoanalysis (Jung, 1911-12/1952; McGuire, 1974). In developing and
articulating his mature psychological theory, Jung always insisted that he was working as
a scientist and empiricist, but he increasingly applied his &#145;empiricism&#146; to the
investigation of religious phenomena (Jung, 1928-54). His dual interest is conspicuous in
the three &#145;Terry Lectures&#146; on &#145;Psychology and Religion&#146; that he
delivered at Yale University in 1937. These were part of a series of &#145;Lectures on
Religion in the light of Science and Philosophy&#146; (Jung, 1938/1940, p. 3). They
focused on a set of dreams of a scientist, showing, Jung argued, the spontaneous operation
of a religious function in the psyche of someone sceptical about religion. The scientist
we now know to have been the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli, with whom Jung
was later to collaborate in developing his ideas on synchronicity (Jung and
Pauli, 1955).
Pauli&#146;s dreams and visions also provided material for one of Jung&#146;s major works
on alchemy (Jung, 1968). This subject, which occupied Jung in the last thirty years of his
life, again joins religion and science: for alchemy, Jung shows, was not just a precursor
of modern chemistry concerned with material transformations but also, in many cases, an
esoteric religious discipline concerned with the spiritual transformation of the
personality. Many of Jung&#146;s other late works&#151;<i>Aion</i> (1951a), &#145;Answer
to Job&#146;<i> </i>(1952a), &#145;On the Nature of the Psyche&#146; (1947/1954), and not
least &#145;Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle&#146; (1952b)&#151;also evince
this preoccupation with religion, science, and the relationship between them.</p>

<p align="justify">Jung&#146;s guiding motive throughout all of this was to preserve religion in the face
of science. In a 1933 letter to Pastor Josef Shattauer, Jung confided that &#145;it is
exceedingly difficult nowadays to inculcate into people any conception of genuine
religiosity. I have found that religious terminology only scares them off still more, for
which reason I always have to tread the path of science and experience, quite irrespective
of any tradition, in order to get my patients to acknowledge spiritual truths&#146; (Jung,
1973, p. 118). In 1945, writing to Father Victor White, Jung claimed that his 1911-12 book
translated as <i>The Psychology of the Unconscious</i> &#145;was written by a psychiatrist
for the purpose of submitting the necessary material to his psychiatric colleagues,
material which would demonstrate to them the importance of religious symbolism&#146;. In
the same letter he explained: &#145;My personal view &#133; is that man&#146;s vital
energy or libido is the divine pneuma all right and it was this conviction which it was my
secret purpose to bring into the vicinity of my colleagues&#146; understanding&#146;
(Jung, 1973, pp. 383-84; see also pp. 349-50).</p>

<p align="justify">At early stages in his career, Jung toyed with the <i>conflict</i> model of the
relationship between religion and science. In doing so, his hope was that religion might
win out. For example, in the last of his <i>Zofingia Lectures</i> he longs for the return
of a mystical approach to religion, even if this entails &#145;the possibility of social
and scientific indifference and call[ing] into question the further progress of
civilisation&#146; (Jung, 1896-99, par. 290). However, Jung quickly recognised that on
most points of direct confrontation and conflict between religion and science, science was
likely to prove the victor. &#145;The imposing arguments of science,&#146; he
acknowledges, &#145;represent the highest degree of intellectual certainty yet achieved by
the mind of man. So at least it seems to the man of today&#146; (Jung, 1957, par. 543).
Consequently, &#145;the guardians and custodians of symbolical truth, namely the
religions, have been robbed of their efficacy by science&#146; (Jung, 1911-12/1952, par.
336).</p>

<p align="justify">Jung therefore increasingly appealed to the <i>independence</i> position. &#145;My
subjective attitude,&#146; he wrote in 1933, &#145;is that I hold every religious position
in high esteem but draw an inexorable dividing line between the content of belief and the
requirements of science&#146; (Jung, 1973, p. 125). At a talk he gave in London in 1939, a
questioner put it to him that &#145;There is obviously, and always has been, a conflict
between religion and science. &#133; How do you bring about a reconciliation, which
obviously is the sort of thing that is needed?&#146; Jung replied: &#145;There is no
conflict between religion and science. That is a very old-fashioned idea. Science has to
consider what there is. There is religion &#133;. Science cannot establish [or, Jung also
implies, refute] a religious truth. &#133; Our science is phenomenology&#146; (Jung, 1939,
pars. 691-92). Again, no less explicitly, he wrote in 1946: &#145;Science is human
knowledge, theology divine knowledge. Therefore the two are incommensurable&#146; (Jung,
1973, p. 411; see also pp. 119, 124, 346, 350, 384).</p>

<p align="justify">From the safety of this basic position of independence, Jung explored bolder
possibilities for <i>dialogue</i> and <i>integration</i> between religion and science.
&#145;A rapprochement between empirical science and religious experience,&#146; he writes
in <i>Mysterium Coniunctionis</i>, &#145;would in my opinion be fruitful for both. Harm
can result only if one side or the other remains unconscious of the limitations of its
claim to validity&#146; (Jung, 1954-55, par. 457). He notes that &#145;inside the
religious movement there [have been] any number of attempts to combine science with
religious belief and practice, as for instance Christian Science, theosophy, and
anthroposophy&#146; (Jung, 1936, par. 863). However, he held these particular attempts in
low esteem, and this may account for his occasional repudiation of any integrative intent
on his own part. For example, to one of the same correspondents to whom he had declared
his belief in the independence of religion and science, he wrote: &#145;I am wholly
incorrigible and utterly incapable of coming up with a mixture of theology and
science&#146; (Jung, 1973, p. 125). Nevertheless, he did aim to promote dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">I start from a positive Christianity which is as much Catholic as Protestant, and I
    endeavour in a scientifically responsible manner to point out those empirically graspable
    facts which make the justification of Christian and, in particular, Catholic dogma at
    least plausible, and besides that are best suited to give the scientific mind an access to
    understanding.</p>
    <p align="justify">(Jung, 1973, pp. 349-50)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">Certain statements even point directly towards integration&#151;at least if we bear in
mind Jung&#146;s insistence that his psychology was scientific: &#145;I would surely be
among the first to welcome an explicit attempt to integrate the findings of psychology
into the ecclesiastical doctrine,&#146; he wrote to Father White in 1945 (Jung, 1973, p.
385).</p>

<p align="justify">Jung was enabled to explore these possibilities by the phenomenological emphasis within
his psychological theory. Basing himself on his understanding of Kant&#146;s epistemology
(see Voogd, 1984), Jung argued that things in themselves, whether material things or
spiritual things, cannot be known other than as mediated to consciousness in the form of
psychic images. Our primary reality, he repeatedly stated, the only reality of which we
can be immediately aware, is psychic reality (e.g., Jung, 1939/1954, par. 760; 1963, pp.
323-24). This notion provides a middle ground in which images stemming from the realm of
matter (the traditional province of science) and images stemming from the realm of spirit
(the traditional province of religion) can be treated even-handedly within the same field.
The primary reality of these images, whatever their putative origin, is psychic. The mere
fact that they occur as psychic images guarantees them reality and importance and some
basic affinity with one another. Particularly important for Jung is the implication that
religious images no less than any other kind deserve to be taken seriously (Jung,
1938/1940, pars. 4-5).</p>

<p align="justify">Combined with the specific structures and processes postulated in his theory&#151;the
collective unconscious, archetypes, compensation, individuation, etc.&#151;this
psychological perspective provided Jung with a vantage point from which he could,
reflexively, comment back on religion and science. For instance, he argues that &#145;it
is out of himself and out of his peculiar constitution that man has produced his sciences.
They are <i>symptoms</i> of his psyche&#146; (Jung, 1930-31, par. 752). He remarks on the
presence within both religion and science of guiding images and myths (Jung, 1919, par.
278; 1927, pars. 327; 1963, p. 313). Above all, he enjoyed pointing to the hidden presence
of religious attitudes within science: he quotes with approval William James&#146;s
statement that &#145;our scientific temper is devout&#146; (Jung, 1921, par. 528) and
makes similar references of his own to the deification of matter (Jung, 1938/1954, par.
195), the asceticism of the scientist (Jung, 1939/1954, par. 786), and the way faith in
science can act as a defence or compensation for superstitious impulses (Jung, 1916, par.
495; 1938/1940, par. 81). In general, the implication that both religious phenomena
(including experiences, doctrines, and rituals) and scientific phenomena (including
observations, theories, and practices) present themselves as psychic images enabled Jung
to discuss any of these phenomena as relative, conditioned, susceptible to pragmatic and
psychological evaluation, and both open to and often requiring change&#151;all of this
without making any judgement about the spiritual or material reality or truth that may
underlie the phenomenal images.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION AND SCIENCE ON SYNCHRONICITY</p>

<p align="justify">However, Jung also made a bolder attempt at rapprochement between religion and science
in the form of his theory of synchronicity. This theory does not pivot so much on the
notion of psychic reality. Indeed, as we shall see, it arguably represents an attempt by
Jung to extricate his psychology from the charge of reductionism prompted by his emphasis
on psychic reality.</p>

<p align="justify">The theory of synchronicity drew on both religious and scientific influences. The
scientific influences are the more obvious, as Jung pushed these to the fore when
presenting his theory. In the first place, there was Jung&#146;s usual
&#145;empiricism&#146;, that is to say, his accumulation of observational data. He refers
to &#145;the innumerable cases of meaningful coincidence that have been observed not only
by me but by many others, and recorded in large collections&#146; (Jung, 1951b, par. 983).
In the second place, there was Jung&#146;s familiarity with recent discoveries in physics.
Einstein was Jung&#146;s dinner guest on several occasions between 1909 and 1912 and, says
Jung, &#145;It was Einstein who set me off thinking about a possible relativity of time as
well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than thirty years later,&#146; he
continues, &#145;this stimulus led to my relation with the physicist Professor W. Pauli
and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity&#146; (Jung, 1976, p. 109). Through discussions
with Pauli, Jung deepened his understanding of such features of quantum physics as
complementarity and acausality, both of which were to figure in Jung&#146;s presentation
of synchronicity (Jung, 1947/1954, pars. 439-40; 1952b, pars. 818-20, 959, 963-67; Main,
1997, pp. 16-17, 122-30). In the third place, there was Jung&#146;s interest in the newly
developed field of experimental parapsychology. He was particularly inspired by J. B.
Rhine&#146;s experiments at Duke University which seemed to provide robust statistical
evidence for the existence of extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis, in other words,
for connections between events that did not depend on any known form of psychophysical
causation and even seemed to transgress the barriers of time and space (Jung, 1952b, pars.
833-40; 1973, pp. 180-82, 190, 378-79, 493-95; Main, 1997, pp. 15-16, 103-11).</p>

<p align="justify">The religious influences on Jung&#146;s theory of synchronicity are less
explicit&#151;interestingly so. In his efforts to highlight the scientific evidence for
his theory, Jung introduces the religious influences on it covertly in scientific,
philosophical, or historical disguise. For example, one major influence is the Chinese
divinatory system of the <i>I Ching</i>. This is deeply embedded in Chinese religious
thought but Jung emphasises its &#145;experimental foundation&#146;, its
&#145;experiment-with-the-whole&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par. 865); in an earlier discussion he
had referred to the <i>I Ching</i> as the &#145;standard text book&#146; of Chinese
science (Jung, 1930, par. 80). Again, instead of referring to the traditional religious
concern with the post-mortem existence of the soul, Jung refers to out-of-body and
near-death experiences as studied empirically by psychical researchers (Jung, 1952b, pars.
949-55). Where he might have discussed religious experiences of mystical unity, he refers
to the philosophical Taoism of Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu (Jung, 1952b, pars. 916-24). Where
he might have discussed religious notions of Providence, he refers to philosophical
notions of pre-established harmony in Leibniz (Jung, 1952b, pars. 937-39). In his major
essay on synchronicity, discussion of the religious concept of continuous creation, very
suggestive for Jung&#146;s theme, is relegated to a footnote on the penultimate page
(Jung, 1952b, par. 967 n. 17). Jung mentions Christian religious thought as having
influenced him not in terms of its doctrines and theology but primarily through providing
historical instances of synchronicity encountered in the course of his research into
symbols (Jung, 1951a; 1963, p. 210; Main, 1997, pp. 14-15). Other demonstrable religious
influences go unmentioned: for example, Jung&#146;s personal religious experiences, which
included spiritualistic encounters with otherworldly beings and mystical visions of unity
(Jung, 1963, pp. 174-78, 270-77; Main, 1997, pp. 2-7, 60-61, 136-41).</p>

<p align="justify">This fore-grounding of the scientific credibility of his theory and downplaying its,
nevertheless easily detectable, religious influences illustrate Jung&#146;s awareness that
the route to intellectual respectability lay through science. Nevertheless, it is
interesting that, in covertly introducing the religious influences, Jung sometimes
implicitly demonstrated the extent to which he felt the religious and scientific
categories could interact&#151;and no longer simply on the basis of their shared grounding
in psyche. For example, he implies that the concept of science should be broad enough to
accommodate the kinds of &#145;experimental&#146; observation involved in divination, and
that the concerns of religion, such as the survival of the soul, should not be kept
insulated from the investigative procedures and insights of the sciences. Further, if we
recall Jung&#146;s complaint that &#145;In science I missed the factor of meaning; and in
religion, that of empiricism&#146; (Jung, 1963, p. 79), we can sense the measure of
integration he has achieved for himself with his theory of synchronicity. For in this
theory Jung has championed precisely the factor of meaning; and he has done so on as solid
a base of empiricism as he could manage.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">THE INFLUENCE OF SYNCHRONICTY ON RELIGION AND SCIENCE</p>

<p align="justify">Not only did Jung&#146;s understanding of religion and science influence his theory of
synchronicity, his theory of synchronicity, once formulated, had implications back on his
understanding of religion and science. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">In a 1955 letter to R. F. C. Hull, Jung reported: &#145;The latest comment about
&quot;Synchronicity&quot; is that it cannot be accepted because it shakes the security of
our scientific foundations, as if this were not exactly the goal I am aiming
at&#133;&#146; (Jung, 1976, p. 217). On the same day he wrote to Michael Fordham of
&#145;the impact of synchronicity upon the fanatical one-sidedness of scientific
philosophy&#146; (Jung, 1976, p. 216). Specifically, Jung thought that his work on
synchronicity demonstrated the need to expand the current conception of science in order
to include, in addition to the classical concepts of time, space, and causality, a
principle of acausal connection through meaning (Jung, 1952b, pars. 961-63). This, he
concluded, would introduce the psychic factor of meaning into our scientific picture of
the world, help get rid of &#145;the incommensurability between the observed and the
observer&#146;, and make possible a &#145;whole judgement&#146; (Jung, 1952b, par.
961)&#151;that is, a judgement that takes into consideration psychological as well as
physical factors (Jung, 1952b, par. 964). Because for Jung the psychological mediates
between the physical and the spiritual, to link the physical and psychological in this way
entails setting up a potential bridge between the physical and the spiritual, hence
between science and religion. These bold conclusions and implications from Jung&#146;s
work on synchronicity resonate with many subsequent attempts to develop more holistic
models of science&#151;some directly exploring Jung&#146;s suggestions, for instance those
of David Peat (1987) and Victor Mansfield (1995), others working independently but aware
of Jung&#146;s contribution and possibly influenced or inspired by it, for instance those
of David Bohm (1980) and Rupert Sheldrake (1981).</p>

<p align="justify">Jung applied his theory of synchronicity to religious phenomena less systematically. He
invokes it on several occasions when discussing the possibility of life after death,
arguing that the transtemporal dimension indicated by synchronistic experiences provides
for the possibility of a kind of &#145;existence outside time&#146;, which may therefore
also be &#145;outside change&#146; and possess &#145;relative eternity&#146; (Jung, 1976,
p. 561; see further Main, 1997, pp. 38, 142-57). He also invokes synchronicity both as a
descriptive equivalent of religious miracles and as a theory for trying to understand them
(Jung, 1976, pp. 21, 537, 540, 576; Main, 1997, pp. 38, 162-64). Again, the theory of
synchronicity implicitly contributed to Jung&#146;s understanding of experiences of
mystical unity (Jung, 1863, pp. 274-75; Main, 1997, pp. 37, 136-41). However, it remained
for later writers, notably Robert Aziz (1990), to draw out the most important implication
of the theory of synchronicity for Jung&#146;s understanding of religion. Jung&#146;s
psychology of religion was often criticised by theologians for being a form of
psychological reductionism. Jung may have been well disposed towards religion, and he may
have provided a strategy for taking religious phenomena seriously in the face of the
reductive claims of materialistic science, but because his model emphasised the primacy of
psychic reality and, on epistemological grounds, denied that anything non-psychic could be
directly experienced, it seemed to many that he was in effect reducing religion to
psychology. God as an objective external reality seemed to have been replaced by the image
of God in a person&#146;s mind (see Aziz, 1990, pp. 46-49). In defence of Jung, Aziz
directs attention to synchronistic events. Such events indicate that meanings experienced
psychically can also non-projectively be experienced outwardly. In the example given at
the beginning of this paper, the appearance and behaviour of the real scarab beetle
demonstrated that the meaning expressing itself in the patient&#146;s dream of a scarab
was not only internal and subjective but could also involve the external, natural world.
Neither, then, is there any reason to suppose that the meaning expressed in a
person&#146;s image of God is only internal and subjective. That meaning too could express
itself outwardly, neither caused by nor projected from an individual psyche (see
Aziz,
1990, pp. 179-80).</p>

<p align="justify">In all of the above instances of the influence of synchronicity on Jung&#146;s
understanding of religion and science, the underlying motive of promoting dialogue and
integration is easily discernible. In uniting or bringing into closer relationship the
inner psychic and outer material realms, Jung is establishing the basis for a
corresponding rapprochement of at least some parts of the discourses of religion and
science. Moreover, he is doing this in a manner that is less dependent on the notion of
the primacy of psychic reality than was the case with his pre-synchronistic psychology of
religion.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">IMPLICATIONS FOR ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY</p>

<p align="justify">As has already been hinted, the theory of synchronicity has some important theoretical
implications for Jung&#146;s psychological model. Several of these further promote
Jung&#146;s task of preserving religion in the face of science. Most importantly,
synchronicity entails a broadening of the concept of the archetype, so that it can be seen
as not just a psychic factor but a psychophysical one, or rather as &#145;grounded on an
as yet unknown substrate possessing material and at the same time psychic qualities&#146;
(Jung, 1958a, par. 780). The phenomenon of synchronicity, Jung states, leads to the
postulation of &#145;a unitary aspect of being&#146; at the deepest level of the
collective unconscious (Jung, 1954-55, par. 662). Against the background of such a
theoretical notion, mystical experiences of unity of the kind Jung himself reported (Jung,
1963, pp. 270-77) become more intelligible.</p>

<p align="justify">Related to this, I would argue that Jung might have seen in synchronicity a means of
firming up his notion of the transpersonal nature of the collective unconscious and
archetypes. When arguing for this transpersonal viewpoint, Jung generally appealed to
&#145;the repeated observation that, for instance, the myths and fairy tales of world
literature contain definite motifs which crop up everywhere&#146;, and that &#145;We meet
these same motifs in the fantasies, dreams, deliria, and delusions of individuals living
today&#146; (Jung, 1958b, par. 847). He tried to establish that in at least some cases the
&#145;individuals living today&#146; could not possibly have been exposed to any cultural
expression of these motifs. Therefore, when the motifs emerged from the unconscious of
such individuals, there could be no origin for them in their personal history; they
demonstrated the existence of a collective or transpersonal dimension to the unconscious.
However, problematically for Jung, in all cases of the emergence of such motifs
alternative explanations seem at least as plausible as the hypothesis of a collective
unconscious. One alternative explanation is that the motifs do indeed arise independently
in each individual but this is because all individuals, <i>in their personal lives</i>,
are subject to the same basic range of typical experiences (see, e.g., Palmer, 1997, pp.
176-81). Another alternative explanation, this time denying the independent origin of the
motifs, is cryptomnesia&#151;the possibility that cultural expressions of the motifs may
have been observed but then forgotten, or observed subliminally without ever having
entered conscious awareness (see, e.g., Noll, 1994a, pp. 84-85). At this point, Jung could
refer, as Aziz was to do in relation to religion, to synchronistic experiences. For in
such experiences the same pattern of meaning expresses itself both in the psyche and,
without any causal or projective relationship, in the external world. This alone, Jung
could argue, is sufficient to demonstrate the transpersonal nature of the unconscious.
Whether or not his patient had prior exposure to images of scarabs, and whether or not she
could have acquired from her personal experience a disposition to produce symbols of
rebirth, the synchronicity suggests that some factor larger than her personal psyche has
been involved in the organisation of the events&#151;a factor that encompasses the
external world of nature in addition to her inner psychic world.</p>

<p align="justify">On a more practical level, the concept of synchronicity helps to valorise a certain
class of numinous events that might otherwise go unnoticed, not least because of their
evanescence, irrationality, and (more so than with dreams, for instance) irregular
occurrence. In providing at least a tentative framework for understanding such
experiences, the theory of synchronicity enables us to bring them into view, acknowledge
them, and question them for any information they may hold, whether in clinical or cultural
settings. This is all the more important since such experiences, even when recognised, are
often taboo. Jung reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">As a psychiatrist and psychotherapist I have often come up against the phenomena in
    question and could convince myself how much these inner experiences meant to my patients.
    In most cases they were things which people do not talk about for fear of exposing
    themselves to thoughtless ridicule. I was amazed to see how many people have had
    experiences of this kind and how carefully the secret was guarded.</p>

<p align="justify">At a deeper practical level, it has been argued recently by George Bright that
synchronicity provides the theoretical basis for a kind of analytic attitude that is
distinctively Jungian (Bright, 1997). Jung&#146;s notion of synchronicity implies that
meaning exists objectively not only in the psyche but also in the physical world. &#145;In
analysis,&#146; Bright argues, &#145;the implication of this is that as well as the
subjective meaning which analyst and patient <i>create</i>, there is also an underlying
objective aspect of meaning which we therefore have to try to <i>find</i>&#146; (Bright,
1997, p. 619). However, since &#145;this aspect of meaning is essentially unconscious, it
can never be fully elucidated or comprehended&#146; (Bright, 1997, p. 619). Therefore,
&#145;both analyst and patient are &#133; restrained from attributing meaning to the
analytic material as if the conscious meanings they find or create were objectively or
absolutely true&#146; (Bright, 1997, p. 618). More particularly, we are presented with
&#145;a way of connecting that tries not to do violence to the material through crude,
potentially dissociative attribution of cause&#146; (Bright, 1997, p. 614). This
acknowledgement within the analytic setting of objective, transpsychic meaning that can
never be exhaustively known and that invites an inquiring but respectful attitude towards
it further promotes the alignment of Jung&#146;s psychology with the concerns of religion.</p>

<p align="justify">CONCLUDING REMARKS</p>

<p align="justify">For almost as long as they have existed, the various forms of depth psychology have
provoked controversy concerning their status in relation to religion and science. Freud,
of course, thought of psychoanalysis as a science and used it as an instrument for
unmasking religion as infantile, neurotic, obsessive, and illusory (Freud, 1912-13, 1927,
1939). Jung, too, though emphasising the primacy of psychic reality, liked to present
analytical psychology as a science. However, he used it as an instrument for restoring to
religion its dignity, meaning, vitality, and reality (Jung, 1928-54). Critics and
revisionists of both psychoanalysis and analytical psychology, indeed of depth psychology
in general, have argued that these bodies of thought are not science but something
else&#151;negatively, pseudo-science, more positively, hermeneutics (Bateman and Holmes,
1995, pp. 20-22). Therefore, it could be argued, neither psychoanalytic attacks on nor
analytical psychological defences of religion can claim the support of science. Some have
even charged that psychoanalysis and analytical psychology are themselves quasi-religions
(e.g., Webster, 1996; Noll, 1994b, 1997).</p>

<p align="justify">From the preceding discussion, I think we can see that for Jung the notions of
religion, of science, of the relationship between religion and science, and of analytical
psychology are neither simple nor static. For example, if we look at Jung&#146;s
understanding of religion and science and their interactions before and after he developed
his mature psychological theory, we find that this understanding changed in significant
ways. It then changed further under the impact of his theory of synchronicity&#151;as
indeed did important concepts within his psychological theory itself. I do not think we
should view this negatively as a sign of Jung&#146;s inconsistency, or problematically as
a sign of the mercurial nature of Jung&#146;s intellect, but rather positively as a sign
of the ability of depth psychology, and of specific theories within it, to exert a
transformative influence back on our conceptions of religion and science as well as of
depth psychology itself. Historians have by now amply demonstrated the extent to which our
notions of &#145;religion&#146; and &#145;science&#146; have shifted over time and have
been continually contested and negotiated, while the interactions between these contested
notions have been correspondingly varied and complex (Brooke, 1991; Brooke and Cantor,
1998). Nor does it seem that notions of &#145;psychoanalysis&#146; and &#145;analytical
psychology&#146; are any more clear-cut and stable (Bateman and Holmes, 1995, pp. 16-20;
Samuels, 1985, 1998). It follows that there is unlikely to be any straightforward
relationship of depth psychology to either religion or science. All three concepts or
fields are mutable and capable of standing in various dynamic relationships to one
another. Religion and science can be as much challenged by the perspectives and insights
of depth psychology as depth psychology, throughout its short history, has been challenged
by the perspectives and insights of religion and science.</p>

  </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
  <p align="justify">From practically the beginning of his life right through to its end C.&nbsp;G. Jung was
  absorbed by the kinds of phenomena which can broadly be classified as paranormal -- that
  is, phenomena which defy explanation in normal rational terms. The implications of his
  engagement with this area for his personal and professional development are pervasive.
  Almost all of his major theoretical formulations were influenced by, and in some cases may
  even have taken their origin from, his attempts to come to terms with his experiences,
  observations, and studies of paranormal phenomena (see Charet 1993).</p>
  <p align="justify">The culmination of Jung's lifelong involvement with the paranormal is his theory of <u>synchronicity</u>,
  the view that the structure of reality includes a principle of acausal connection which
  manifests itself most conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult,
  flawed, prone to misrepresentation, this theory nonetheless remains one of the most
  suggestive attempts yet made to bring the paranormal within the bounds of intelligibility.
  It has been found relevant by psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of
  spiritual experience, and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in
  this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of the paranormal.</p>
  <p align="justify">The selections in the present volume -- drawn from Jung's letters, seminars, and
  autobiographical <u>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</u>, as well as from his <u>Collected
  Works</u> -- provide a thematic and roughly chronological overview of his experiences and
  ideas. Part I, `Encountering the Paranormal', contains writings on mediumistic trance
  phenomena (Chapter 1), the reality of spirits and hauntings (Chapter 2), anomalous events
  involved in the development and practice of analytical psychology (Chapter 3), and the
  synchronistic basis of the divinatory techniques of astrology and the <u>I Ching</u>
  (Chapter 4). Part II, `The Theory of Synchronicity', contains Jung's most lucid
  presentation of his theory of synchronicity (Chapter 5), then illustrates more fully his
  ideas, both earlier and later, on some of the central subjects involved in its
  elaboration, specifically parapsychology (Chapter 6), his astrological experiment (Chapter
  7), and physics (Chapter 8). Part III, `Outer Limits', illustrates those of Jung's
  experiences and speculations which touch most directly on questions of transcendence and
  spiritual reality: unitive and other bewildering visions (Chapter 9), intimations of life
  after death (Chapter 10), the UFO enigma (Chapter 11), and a variety of miscellaneous
  topics such as the subtle body, the underlying unity of reality, religious miracles, and
  the role of synchronicity in the evolution of consciousness (Chapter 12).</p>
  <p align="justify">The remainder of this introduction follows the same pattern as the selections. First
  discussed are Jung's experiences and interpretations of the paranormal. Then the various
  other influences that contributed to his formulation of the theory of synchronicity are
  considered. Next the central ideas of the theory of synchronicity itself are examined in
  detail. Finally, there is a review of some of the areas of paranormal experience which
  Jung addressed once he was equipped with the theory of synchronicity.</p>
<b>
</b>
  <p align="justify"><b><a name="JungParanormal">J</a>UNG AND THE PARANORMAL</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's early life was spent in a milieu conducive to his developing an interest in
  paranormal phenomena. Living in the Swiss countryside, he continually heard stories of
  uncanny happenings (Jung 1963: 102) such as `dreams which foresaw the death of a certain
  person, clocks which stopped at the moment of death, glasses which shattered at the
  critical moment' (Jung 1963: 104). The reality of these events, he says, was `taken for
  granted in the world of my childhood' (Jung 1963: 104). More specifically, paranormal
  experiences were virtually commonplace in Jung's family. His maternal grandfather, Samuel
  Preiswerk, had believed himself to be continually surrounded by ghosts and would devote
  one day every week to conversing with the spirit of his deceased first wife, for whom he
  kept a special chair in his study (Jaff 1984: 40). Jung's grandmother Augusta,
  Preiswerk's second wife, was believed to be clairvoyant (Jaff 1984: 40). And the
  couple's daughter, Jung's mother, experienced `strange occurrences' with sufficient
  regularity to write a diary exclusively dedicated to them (Jaff 1971: 2).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's own experiences of the paranormal began at the age of seven or eight. During a
  period when his parents were sleeping apart and there was considerable tension in the
  house, he would sometimes see nocturnal apparitions: `One night I saw coming from [my
  mother's] door a faintly luminous, indefinite figure whose head detached itself from the
  neck and floated along in front of it, in the air, like a little moon' (Jung 1963: 31).</p>
  <p align="justify">When Jung was twenty-three and by that time a medical student, a couple of incidents
  happened which he says were `destined to influence me profoundly' (Jung 1963: 108). On one
  occasion a round walnut table in his family home suddenly and inexplicably split with a
  loud bang. Two weeks later another loud explosion was heard, and it was discovered that a
  steel knife which was in perfect condition and had been used to cut bread just an hour
  before had miraculously shattered into four in a closed drawer (Jung 1963: 107--9). These
  experiences contributed to his decision to enter the then widely despised field of
  psychiatry (Jung 1963: 107, 110--11; also Baumann-Jung 1975: 46).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's own account presents these incidents as connected prefiguratively with sances
  which he claims he heard about and started attending a few weeks later (Jung 1963: 109;
  Jung 1973: 181) but which in fact he had already been attending for several years and had
  even initiated (Hillman 1976: 125; Charet 1993: 155--6). His observations at these
  sances formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation, later published as `On the
  Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena' (1902). The desire to present his
  findings in an optimally objective light is undoubtedly why this as well as his various
  subsequent accounts (Jung 1925: 3--6, 9--10; Jung 1973: 181--2; Jung 1963: 109--10) all
  conceal to various degrees the full extent of his personal involvement. As F.&nbsp;X.
  Charet summarizes what is now known:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">the sances were conducted in Jung's own home, the medium was his cousin, and the
      participants, members of his own family. In addition, a number of the spirits with which
      the medium was allegedly in communication were none other than Jung's ancestors. (Charet
      1993: 288)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This degree of engagement is consistent with other information about Jung's interests
  at the time. In particular, one of the lectures he delivered to his student fraternity,
  the Zofingia Society, consists largely of an impassioned and informed appeal for the
  serious scientific study of spiritualistic phenomena (Jung 1897; see also Oeri 1970:
  187--8).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung describes his experiments with his medium cousin as `the one great experience
  which wiped out all my earlier philosophy and made it possible for me to achieve a
  psychological point of view. I had discovered some objective facts about the human psyche'
  (Jung 1963: 110). The primarily descriptive account given in his dissertation prefigures
  several of the themes of his mature psychology. The medium's ability when in the trance
  state to manifest a variety of seemingly autonomous personalities provided evidence for
  the dissociability and unconscious functioning of the psyche -- observations which would
  eventually lead to the formulation first of complexes and later of archetypes. While
  analyzing his cousin's trances psychiatrically, Jung did not dismiss the psychic
  dissociation as simply pathological; the secondary personalities she was manifesting could
  also be therapeutic, representing `attempts of the future character to break through'
  (Jung 1902: 79). The emphasis here on the positive, prospective tendency of apparently
  pathological symptoms foreshadows Jung's later ideas of compensation, individuation, and
  active imagination.</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung continued to attend sances for at least another thirty years (Charet 1993:
  172--4, 197, 269). Already by 1905 he could report that he had investigated a total of
  eight mediums (Jung 1905: 301). His publicly expressed view at this time was that the
  results were `of purely psychological interest .... Everything that may be considered a
  scientifically established fact belongs to the domain of the mental and cerebral processes
  and is fully explicable in terms of the laws already known to science' (Jung 1905:
  301--2).</p>
  <p align="justify">Even after the beginning of his association with Freud in 1907, Jung's preoccupation
  with the paranormal continued. Initially, Freud was highly sceptical and dismissive about
  the entire field -- an attitude expressed most vividly in his exhortation to Jung to make
  the sexual theory `a dogma, an unshakeable bulwark' against `the black tide of mud ... of
  occultism' (Jung 1963: 147--8). It is true that this resistance eventually mellowed to the
  point where he was actually encouraging Jung's experiments and even attending sances
  himself (Charet 1993: 196--7). `In matters of occultism', he wrote to Jung on 15 June
  1911, `I have grown humble ... my hubris has been shattered' (in Jung 1963: 335). However,
  he was still not willing to expose the full extent of his interest publicly, nor would he
  accede to Jung's demand that the theoretical basis of psychoanalysis be broadened to take
  account of spiritualistic phenomena that were inadequately explained in terms of
  sexuality.</p>
  <p align="justify">On one occasion, this tension between Freud and Jung resulted in an argument that had
  both an interesting psychological context and an even more interesting parapsychological
  outcome. Earlier in the evening Freud had, as he afterwards wrote in a letter to Jung,
  `formally adopted you as an eldest son, anointing you as my successor and crown prince'
  (in Jung 1963: 333). Later in the evening, however, in the course of an argument about
  paranormal phenomena, a seemingly unaccountable detonation went off in Freud's bookcase.
  When Freud dismissed Jung's parapsychological interpretation of this event, Jung predicted
  that the same thing would happen again, and so, to Freud's consternation, it did (Jung
  1963: 152). Freud's letter to Jung continues by remarking of this phenomenon, by which he
  admitted to having been impressed, that it `then and there [i.e., immediately after his
  `anointing' of Jung] ... divested me of my paternal dignity' (in Jung 1963: 333). Whether
  or not consciously realized at the time, this incident symbolized the inevitable
  divergence between the two psychologists. One of the main causes of this divergence was
  the significance each attached to paranormal phenomena.</p>
  <p align="justify">In spite of Freud's unaccommodating attitude, Jung's understanding of paranormal
  phenomena undoubtedly benefited from their association. He was led by Freud to appreciate
  the important role that sexuality can indeed play in spiritualistic phenomena. As he
  recognized only after he had written his dissertation, the medium had fallen in love with
  him (Jung 1925: 5) and her inadmissible passion for her cousin -- which may in fact have
  been reciprocal -- had contributed significantly to her experiences, many of which
  involved supposed romances of past members of their shared ancestry.</p>
  <p align="justify">In effecting his break with Freud, Jung was greatly assisted by the influence of the
  psychologists Thodore Flournoy and William James (Shamdasani 1995: 126--7). Like Jung,
  both of them were deeply interested in psychical research and had made close observations
  of mediums; moreover, they were willing, as Freud was not, to consider the phenomena that
  emerged in these contexts in a nonpathological light. While James's influence on Jung was
  mainly through his writings (Jung 1976: 452), Flournoy's was more personal. In an appendix
  contained in the Swiss but omitted in the English edition of <u>Memories, Dreams,
  Reflections</u>, Jung recounts that during the period of his disaffection with Freud he
  would regularly see Flournoy, who both helped him formulate his understanding of Freud's
  limitations and encouraged him in his own researches on somnambulism, parapsychology, and
  the psychology of religion (summarized in Charet 1993: 235). It was also through Flournoy
  that Jung became interested in the creative imagination and specifically in the `Miller
  Fantasies', which were to form the basis for his <u>Symbols of Transformation</u>
  (1911--12/1952) -- the work in which Jung first expressed openly his divergence from Freud
  (Jung 1963: 158; Charet 1993: 235).</p>
  <p align="justify">Validating the creative or, as he came to call it, the `active' imagination was also
  important to Jung personally. He himself had a facility for imaginative thinking, and what
  he learned about this faculty from the Miller material enhanced his ability to cope with
  the deluge of dreams, visions, and paranormal experiences which were released in him in
  the years following his rupture with Freud (Jung 1963: 165--91).</p>
  <p align="justify">Prominent among these experiences were Jung's inner encounters with a variety of
  seemingly autonomous fantasy figures with whom he conversed as though they were spirits
  (Jung 1963: 174--8). The most important such figure was `Philemon', whom Jung described as
  his `ghostly guru', his `psychagogue', a representation of `superior insight' who
  `conveyed to me many an illuminating idea', above all `the insight that there are things
  in the psyche which I do not produce, but which produce themselves and have their own
  life' (Jung 1963: 176--7). One of the earliest experiences Jung mentions specifically of a
  meaningful coincidence concerns this figure: Philemon had appeared in his dreams with
  kingfisher's wings, and Jung, in order to understand the image better, did a painting of
  it. While engaged on this, he happened to find in his garden, for the first and only time,
  a dead kingfisher (Jung 1963: 175--6).</p>
  <p align="justify">Later, in 1916, Jung relates that he felt `compelled from within, as it were, to
  formulate and express what might have been said by Philemon' (Jung 1963: 182). The
  composition of the resulting <u>Septem Sermones ad Mortuos</u>, a series of texts
  addressed to the spirits of the dead, was immediately preceded by a remarkable haunting of
  Jung's house, involving an `ominous atmosphere' and various apparitional and poltergeist
  phenomena experienced not just by himself but by his children and other members of the
  household (Jung 1963: 182--3). As several writers have noted, the <u>Septem Sermones</u>
  -- whose relation to spiritualistic communications is obvious, if also rather eccentric
  (see Segal 1992: 37--8) -- express in germinal form almost all of Jung's developed ideas:
  the nature of the unconscious, individuation, the problem of opposites, the archetypes,
  and the self (see, e.g., Charet 1993: 265--7).</p>
  <p align="justify">In 1919, while in England, Jung delivered to the Society for Psychical Research a
  lecture on `The Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits' (1920/1948). In this
  lecture he explained experiences of one's own soul in terms of complexes of the personal
  unconscious, while seemingly autonomous spirits were explained in terms of complexes of
  the collective unconscious, that is, archetypes (Jung 1920/1948: 309--12). Towards the end
  of the lecture he admitted to having `repeatedly observed the telepathic effects of
  unconscious complexes, and also a number of parapsychic phenomena' (Jung 1920/1948: 318).
  But on the question of the objective existence of spirits he took a cautious position, in
  spite of his own experience of three years earlier. While acknowledging that, from the
  point of view of feeling, it might well be legitimate to believe in spirits, he considered
  that, from the point of view of thinking, there are no grounds for holding that they can
  be known to exist other than as `the exteriorized effects of unconscious complexes': `I
  see no proof whatever', he remarked, `of the existence of real spirits, and until such
  proof is forthcoming I must regard this whole territory as an appendix of psychology'
  (Jung 1920/1948: 318).</p>
  <p align="justify">But Jung was in fact less sceptical than he says here. For example, in a footnote added
  at this point to the 1948 revision of the lecture, he admits:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">After collecting psychological experiences from many people and many countries for over
      fifty years, I no longer feel as certain as I did in 1919, when I wrote this sentence. To
      put it bluntly, I doubt whether an exclusively psychological approach can do justice to
      the phenomena in question. (Jung 1920/1948: 318)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">In the year following his SPR lecture he was again in England and had some very
  disturbing experiences while staying over a series of weekends in a house which he learned
  afterwards was reputed to be haunted: he heard loud thumping and dripping noises, smelled
  foul odours, and on one occasion saw a figure with part of its face missing lying in the
  bed beside him -- all of which phenomena simply disappeared at the first light of dawn
  (Jung 1950b: 320--4). For at least one of these phenomena, the loud dripping noise, he
  could find no adequate physical or psychological explanation (Jung 1950b: 325).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung was also influenced by his continued witnessing of spiritualistic trance
  phenomena. We are told, for instance, of his attendance at sances with Rudi Schneider in
  1925 at which `telekinetic phenomena and the materialization of human limbs were observed'
  (Charet 1993: 282--3, n. 230). At a sance with Oscar Schlag in 1931 `a sample of
  ectoplasm was secured', and on another occasion Jung `embraced Schlag when suddenly
  Schlag's Jacket dematerialized' (Charet 1993: 283, nn. 230--1). On the `question of
  materialization' Jung wrote in 1945: `I have seen enough of this phenomenon to convince me
  entirely of its existence' (Jung 1973: 390). Regarding the objective existence of spirits,
  he recalled in 1946 his discussions many years earlier with the American psychologist and
  psychical researcher James Hyslop:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">He [Hyslop] admitted that, all things considered, all these metapsychic phenomena could
      be explained better by the hypothesis of spirits than by the qualities and peculiarities
      of the unconscious. And here, on the basis of my own experience, I am bound to concede he
      is right. In each individual case I must of necessity be sceptical, but in the long run I
      have to admit that the spirit hypothesis yields better results in practice than any other.
      (Jung 1973: 431)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Of Jung's experiences in this period after 1919 one more deserves mention for the
  significant bearing it had on the development of his concept of the self as the centre of
  psychic totality (Jung 1963: 188). He relates that after he had worked this concept out in
  isolation, he experienced a powerful confirmatory coincidence in which a painting he had
  done, based on a dream, was paralleled by the core idea of a Taoist-alchemical treatise, <u>The
  Secret of the Golden Flower</u>, sent to him by Richard Wilhelm (Jung 1963: 188--9). The
  timely receipt of this treatise was, he says, `the first event which broke through my
  isolation. I became aware of an affinity; I could establish ties with something and
  someone' (Jung 1963: 189).</p>
  <p align="justify">Finally, Jung's thinking was also furthered by the experiences accompanying his heart
  attack in 1944. A series of altered states of consciousness, including a near-death
  experience, attendant coincidence, and some profound states of mystical union, gave him
  the insight, and ultimately the courage, to express himself much more forthrightly on a
  number of controversial topics, including that of synchronicity itself (Jung 1963:
  270--7).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's paranormal experiences and the resulting need adequately to understand them were
  probably the greatest influence on the development of his theory of synchronicity. Such
  intimate personal engagement both gave him an inside view of the kind of psychological
  dynamics that can be involved in paranormal experiences and, even more importantly,
  impressed on him the extent to which the experiences can be meaningful. Thus, Jung's own
  experiences seemed to occur at critical junctures in his life: paranormal events
  accompanied his decision to make a career of psychiatry, his conflict and eventual breach
  with Freud, his relationship with his `ghostly guru' Philemon, the writing of the <u>Septem
  Sermones ad Mortuos</u> in which he adumbrated much of his later psychology, his
  formulation of the concept of the self as the centre of psychic totality, and his heart
  attack and transformative near-death experience of 1944.</p>

</b>
  <p align="justify"><b><a name="TOWARDSSYNCHRONICITY">T</a>OWARDS SYNCHRONICITY</b></p>
  <p align="justify">In addition to his personal experiences and observations of paranormal phenomena, a
  number of further influences also played a significant part in Jung's eventual formulation
  of the theory of synchronicity. On the level of spontaneous events, there were the
  meaningful coincidences which he noticed occurring to individual analysands during
  therapeutic sessions as well as to others during seminars that were being held in
  analytical psychology. Other sources of insight were Jung's practical engagement with the
  mantic procedures of astrology and the <u>I Ching</u>, and his cultural researches into
  alchemy and other esoteric traditions. No less important again was his awareness of recent
  developments in science, above all in the new discipline of parapsychology and the then
  radically transformed field of physics. It is worth looking at each of these influences in
  turn, since their contributions to his developing theory are varied and at times complex.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="TherapeuticContext">T</a>he therapeutic context</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's specific interest in meaningful coincidence dates from the mid 1920s, when, as
  he says,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">I was investigating the phenomena of the collective unconscious and kept coming across
      connections which I could not explain as chance groupings or `runs.' What I found were
      `coincidences' which were connected so meaningfully that their `chance' concurrence would
      represent a degree of improbability that would have to be expressed by an astronomical
      figure. (Jung 1952: 437)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">In his analytic practice, Jung was impressed both by the frequency with which
  coincidence phenomena occurred and by their meaningfulness to those who experienced them:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">As a psychiatrist and psychotherapist I have often come up against the phenomena in
      question and could convince myself how much these inner experiences meant to my patients.
      In most cases they were things which people do not talk about for fear of exposing
      themselves to thoughtless ridicule. I was amazed to see how many people have had
      experiences of this kind and how carefully the secret was guarded. (Jung 1952: 420)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">For example, a patient, whose problem lay in her excessive and seemingly intractable
  rationalism, was telling Jung an impressive dream in which she had been given a costly
  jewel in the form of a scarab beetle. Just at that moment an insect began tapping against
  the consulting room window. Jung let it in, caught it in his hands, and, realizing it was
  a form of scarabaeid beetle, presented it to his patient with the words, `Here is your
  scarab'. The irrationality yet obvious meaningfulness of this paralleling between real
  life and her dream was so striking that it broke through the patient's resistances and
  enabled her treatment to proceed (Jung 1951b: 525--6; 1952: 438--9).</p>
  <p align="justify">The special value of events such as this for the development of the theory of
  synchronicity lay in the fact that they occurred in a psychotherapeutic context, so that
  their accompanying psychological dynamics could be observed particularly closely. Jung
  noted, for instance, that the meaning which coincidences have for their subject, including
  their attendant emotional charge or numinosity, seems to stem from the underlying presence
  of an archetype, activated usually in response to the person having reached some kind of
  psychological impasse. Thus, in the above case, Jung believed the archetype of rebirth had
  been activated by the patient's inability to see beyond her rationalism, by her need for
  `psychic renewal' (1952: 439). As Robert Aziz has shown (Aziz 1990: 66--90), implicit in
  Jung's analysis of this and other cases is his understanding of synchronicity as an
  expression of the process of individuation furthered through compensation. Thus only after
  the excessive rationalism of the patient's conscious attitude had been compensated from
  the unconscious by the powerful irrational event of the synchronicity, could her `process
  of transformation [i.e., her individuation] ... at last begin to move' (Jung 1952: 439).
  Cases such as this also enabled Jung to observe that coincidences can be symbolic in their
  meaning. His reason for supposing the archetype of rebirth to have been active in the
  woman's experience was his knowledge that `The scarab is a classic example of a rebirth
  symbol' (Jung 1952: 439).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="SeminarContext">T</a>he seminar context</u></p>
  <p align="justify">From 1925 to 1939 Jung held a series of English language seminars at the Psychological
  Club in Zurich, during which meaningful coincidences sometimes occurred. Indeed one can
  actually monitor Jung, during the course of the 1928--1930 seminars on dream analysis,
  moving towards a first formulation of the concept of synchronicity.</p>
  <p align="justify">On 14 November 1928 the seminar group was discussing the meaning of certain forms of
  ritual sport, since one of the dreams being examined (the important `initial dream' of the
  analysis) contained an image of a square amphitheatre which made the dreamer think of the
  game of <u>jeu de paume</u>, an early form of tennis. Amplifying on the idea that this
  game could be viewed as a form of symbolic ceremonial, Jung associated the game with the
  sport of bull-fighting, which in turn he connected with the ancient cult of Mithras, the
  bull god (Jung 1928--30: 24--5). This turned out to be the first coincidence, for it
  happened that, unknown to Jung, one of the participants at the seminar had dreamed the
  night before that she had been present at a bull-fight in Spain (Jung 1928--30: 35).</p>
  <p align="justify">When this dream was mentioned at the next meeting a week later on 21 November, it was
  followed by a discussion of its meaning and the meaning of the bull symbol generally,
  during which Jung reported that `not long ago I had a letter from a patient [in Mexico], a
  lady who had just been to a bull-fight ...' (Jung 1928--30: 36). Then, at the meeting
  following this, on 28 November, Jung began by announcing that the discussion of the bull
  dream and the meaning of the bull-fight had `brought interesting coincidences to light'
  (Jung 1928--30: 43). For he had just received another letter from the woman in Mexico in
  which she commented on the bull-fight she had been to in terms very similar to those used
  by Jung when he had initially spoken about the bull-fight symbol. Allowing time for
  postage, Jung calculated that the letter must have been written `just about the day when
  we first spoke of the bull in the seminar' (Jung 1928--30: 44). He remarks: `My friend is
  a quite independent observer, but she got the gist of [the symbolic significance of the
  bull-fight] and in that moment found it necessary to convey it to me' (Jung 1928--30: 44).</p>
  <p align="justify">Equally strikingly, Jung reported that the person whose dreams were being analyzed in
  the seminar (a patient not a participant at the seminar) had spent from the 20th to the
  24th November `making a picture which he could not understand' (Jung 1928--30: 43). It was
  of a bull's head holding the disc of the sun between its horns, as in representations of
  sacred bull gods. Thus he drew just what was being discussed by the seminar group and over
  the very period when they were discussing it. `I told him', Jung reported, `that we were
  talking of the bull in connection with his dream, and that his drawing <u>synchronizes</u>
  with that' (Jung 1928--30: 43; emphasis added).</p>
  <p align="justify">Coincidences such as these, Jung told the seminar group, have a sort of `irrational
  regularity' (Jung 1928--30: 43), which is why we notice them. `The East bases much of its
  science on this irregularity', he continued, `and considers coincidences as the reliable
  basis of the world rather than causality. <u>Synchronism</u> is the prejudice of the East;
  causality is the modern prejudice of the West' (Jung 1928--30: 44--5; emphasis added).</p>
  <p align="justify">In November 1928 Jung is recorded as having used the words `synchronize' and
  `synchronism'. A year later, on 4 December 1929, another incident occurred. The
  five-year-old child of one of the participants at the seminar made two drawings
  incorporating symbols (principally the cross and the crescent) that were being talked
  about, yet the child had not actually been exposed to any information about the seminars.
  Jung remarks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">Since I have seen many other examples of the same kind in which people not concerned
      were affected, I have invented the word <u>synchronicity</u> as a term to cover these
      phenomena, that is, things happening at the same time moment as an expression of the same
      time content. (Jung 1928--30: 417)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">From this series of incidents two important points can be noted about the way Jung was
  initially conceiving of synchronicity. First, he was understanding it to be a phenomenon
  which could have its impact on the widest collective level. Thus, the whole nexus of bull
  coincidences manifested via four different people: Jung himself, who first mentioned the
  cult of the bull god Mithras; the seminar participant who dreamed of a bull-fight the
  night before Jung mentioned the bull god; the person whose dreams were being analyzed and
  who felt moved to draw a bull's head; and the correspondent who wrote to Jung with her
  symbolic interpretation of the bull-fight she had recently attended. The last two of these
  people were not even present at the seminars, and one of them was many thousands of miles
  away in Mexico. Again, of the bull-fight dream Jung remarked that `any one of us might
  have dreamt it' (Jung 1928--30: 36).</p>
  <p align="justify">The second point is that Jung was stressing the idea of the quality of particular
  moments of time. `In 1929', he remarked at the end of one seminar (27 November 1929),
  `everything has the cast and brand of this year. And the children born in this year will
  be recognisable as part of a great process and marked by a particular condition' (Jung
  1928--30: 412). This idea also played a central role in the way Jung generally articulated
  his understanding of astrology and the <u>I Ching</u>.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Astrology">A</a>strology</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's interest in astrology dates from around 1911. In a letter to Freud of 12 June of
  that year he reports:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">My evenings are taken up very largely with astrology. I make horoscopic calculations in
      order to find a clue to the core of psychological truth. Some remarkable things have
      turned up .... I dare say that one day we shall find in astrology a good deal of knowledge
      that has been intuitively projected into the heavens. For instance, it appears that the
      signs of the zodiac are character pictures, in other words libido symbols which depict the
      typical qualities of the libido at a given moment. (Jung 1973: 24)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This interest continued to the end of Jung's life. For example, in a letter to
  B.&nbsp;V. Raman dated 6 September 1947, he reaffirmed the practical importance of
  astrology for the psychologist:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">In cases of difficult psychological diagnosis I usually get a horoscope in order to
      have a further point of view from an entirely different angle. I must say that I very
      often found that the astrological data elucidated certain points which I otherwise would
      have been unable to understand. (Jung 1973: 475)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This practical involvement provided Jung with data which seemed to support the idea of
  moments of time having particular qualities. Thus, in a letter to B. Baur (29 January
  1934), after discussing the precession of the equinoxes, he remarks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">The fact that astrology nevertheless yields valid results proves that it is not the
      apparent positions of the stars which work, but rather the times which are measured or
      determined by arbitrarily named stellar positions. Time thus proves to be a stream of
      energy filled with qualities and not, as our philosophy would have it, an abstract concept
      or precondition of knowledge. (Jung 1973: 138--9)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Initially, Jung seems to have hoped that astrology might be able to demonstrate
  objectively a relationship of synchronicity between temporal determinants and individual
  character (Jung 1976: 476; Jung 1952: 454--5). Later, however, his attitude became more
  complex and ambivalent. This change stemmed partly from his own astrological experiment,
  which revealed the extent of the astrologer's psychic participation in the handling of
  astrological material (Jung 1952: 459--84; see also Hyde 1992: 121--39), and partly from
  recent discoveries concerning the possible influence of planetary positions on solar
  proton radiation. Those discoveries suggested that there might be some causal basis for
  the apparent efficacy of astrology (Jung 1951b: 527--8; Jung 1976: 23--4) -- or even that
  astrology might be partly causal and partly synchronistic (Jung 1976: 177, 421, 428--30).
  Finally, for all his early enthusiasm for the idea of qualitative time, which was
  articulated even more fulsomely in relation to the <u>I Ching</u>, Jung did eventually (in
  a letter of 1954) express dissatisfaction with this notion, rejecting it as tautological
  and, rather than using it as the basis for an explanation of synchronicity, claiming to
  have `replaced it with the idea of synchronicity' (Jung 1976: 176).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="TheIChing">T</a>he I Ching</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Around 1920, Jung began experimenting with the ancient Chinese oracle system of the <u>I
  Ching</u>, or <u>Book of Changes</u>, and was deeply impressed by its effectiveness in
  yielding pertinent answers to his questions. He relates how, one summer, he</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">resolved to make an all out attack on the riddle of this book .... I would sit for
      hours on the ground beneath the hundred-year old pear tree, the <u>I Ching</u> beside me,
      practising the technique by referring the resultant oracles to one another in an interplay
      of questions and answers. All sorts of undeniably remarkable results emerged -- meaningful
      connections with my own thought processes which I could not explain to myself .... Time
      and again I encountered amazing coincidences which seemed to suggest the idea of an
      acausal parallelism (a synchronicity as I later called it). (Jung 1963: 342)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Jung's appreciation of the <u>I Ching</u> deepened considerably a couple of years later
  when he met and befriended the German Sinologist Richard Wilhelm, who had just produced a
  new German translation of the book. Jung refers to his friendship with Wilhelm as `one of
  the most significant events of my life' (Jung 1930: 53). He appears to have been
  particularly impressed by Wilhelm's own mastery of the <u>I Ching</u>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">At his first lecture at the Psychological Club in Zurich [in 1923], Wilhelm, at my
      request, demonstrated the use of the <u>I Ching</u> and at the same time made a prognosis
      which, in less than two years, was fulfilled to the letter and with the utmost clarity.
      (Jung 1930: 57)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">It was with reference to the <u>I Ching</u>, at a memorial address for Wilhelm in 1930,
  that Jung made his second recorded use of his new concept: `The science of the <u>I Ching</u>',
  he asserted, `is based not on the causality principle but on one which -- hitherto unnamed
  because not familiar to us -- I have tentatively called the <u>synchronistic</u>
  principle' (Jung 1930: 56). He referred to `psychic parallelisms which simply cannot be
  related to each other causally, but must be connected by another kind of principle
  altogether' (Jung 1930: 56). The essence of this other principle he considered to consist
  `in the relative simultaneity of the events', for time, as he still understood it,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">far from being an abstraction, is a concrete continuum which possesses qualities or
      basic conditions capable of manifesting themselves simultaneously in different places by
      means of an acausal parallelism, such as we find, for instance, in the simultaneous
      occurrence of identical thoughts, symbols, or psychic states. (Jung 1930: 56).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Referring also to the data and claims of astrology, he asserted that `whatever is born
  or done at this particular moment of time has the quality of this moment of time', adding
  confidently that `Here we have the basic formula for the use of the <u>I Ching</u>' (Jung
  1930: 56--7).</p>
  <p align="justify">A fuller exposition of the principle, again preceding the publication of his main
  essays on synchronicity, was also made with reference to the <u>I Ching</u> in Jung's
  `Foreword' to the English rendering of Wilhelm's German translation (Jung 1950a: 590--3).
  Here, as late as 1949, Jung was still emphasizing the factor of the quality of moments of
  time. He writes that `synchronicity takes the coincidence of events in space and time as
  meaning something more than mere chance, namely, a peculiar interdependence of objective
  events among themselves as well as with the subjective (psychic) states of the observer or
  observers' (Jung 1950a: 592). The specific style of thinking implied in this is then
  explicated as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">How does it happen that <u>A'</u>, <u>B'</u>, <u>C'</u>, <u>D'</u>, etc., appear all at
      the same moment and in the same place? It happens in the first place because the physical
      events <u>A'</u> and <u>B'</u> are of the same quality as the psychic events <u>C'</u> and
      <u>D'</u>, and further because all are the exponents of one and the same momentary
      situation. The situation is assumed to represent a legible or understandable picture.
      (Jung 1950a: 593)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Apart from consolidating his understanding of qualitative time, the <u>I Ching</u>
  provided Jung with a means of generating experiences of meaningful coincidence with some
  measure of regularity. At times he practically recommended it to others for such
  experimental purposes (Jung 1976: 491). Again, largely because of this amenability to
  experimental investigation, the system offered a context for looking at some of the
  dynamics of synchronicity. The <u>I Ching</u> hexagrams, for example, seemed to Jung to be
  a kind of readable representation of archetypes (Jung 1963: 294; Jung 1976: 584). This
  connection between hexagrams and archetypes, combined with the fact that the method of
  consulting the oracle is essentially based on number, led Jung to speculate on the
  archetypes of natural numbers and on the possibility of their having a special
  relationship to synchronicity (Jung 1952: 456--8). Finally, the simple fact that the <u>I
  Ching</u> was such a prominent cultural force throughout Chinese history encouraged Jung's
  efforts to present his ideas on synchronicity by providing him with a major precedent for
  the recognition of an acausal principle of connection between events.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Alchemy">A</a>lchemy and other esoteric research</u></p>
  <p align="justify">No less significant for the development of the concept of synchronicity was Jung's
  extensive research into the esoteric traditions of the West. The ancient Greek conception
  of `the sympathy of all things', the medieval and Renaissance theory of correspondences,
  and above all the alchemical understanding of the <u>unus mundus</u> (one world) and of
  the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm also provided acausal connections between
  events (see Jung 1952: 485--98). At times Jung presents his theory of synchronicity as
  simply an up-dating of these esoteric views: `Synchronicity', he writes at the end of his
  1951 Eranos lecture, `is a modern differentiation of the obsolete concept of
  correspondence, sympathy, and harmony' (Jung 1951b: 531). At other times he recognizes
  that his theory differs from these earlier views -- for example, in his rejection of the
  notion of `magical causality', the view that coincidences and paranormal phenomena, rather
  than being acausal, are `somehow due to magical influence' (Jung 1952: 501). What the
  early theories suggest to him instead is that there may be a dimension of meaning that
  does not depend on human subjectivity or projection but is `transcendental' or
  `self-subsistent' -- `a meaning which is <u>a priori</u> in relation to human
  consciousness and apparently exists outside man' (Jung 1952: 501--2).</p>
  <p align="justify">Not only did these esoteric worldviews themselves present a challenge to causality, but
  Jung believed that in the course of his researches into them he had actually uncovered
  some extraordinary objective synchronicities: `my researches into the history of symbols,'
  he writes in the `Foreword' to his 1952 essay, `and of the fish symbol in particular,
  brought the problem [of synchronicity] ever closer to me' (Jung 1952: 419). The reference
  here is to the coincidence, mapped out in detail in <u>Aion</u> (Jung 1951a), `between the
  life of Christ and the objective astronomical event, the entrance of the spring equinox
  into the sign of Pisces'; his discovery of this was another of the factors which `led to
  the problem of synchronicity' (Jung 1963: 210).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Parapsychology">P</a>arapsychology</u></p>
  <p align="justify">While Jung was actively interested in psychical research throughout his life, few
  bodies of work within this field made such a deep impression on him as the
  parapsychological experiments carried out by J.&nbsp;B. Rhine in the first parapsychology
  laboratory, established at Duke University in 1932. These experiments appeared to give
  statistical, that is to say, scientifically respectable, confirmation of the reality of
  both extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis (PK). More importantly the positive
  results of Rhine's experiments did not diminish if the subjects attempting the ESP or PK
  tasks were separated from the target objects by even great distances in space or time
  (Jung 1952: 435). Jung concluded that `in relation to the psyche space and time are, so to
  speak, &quot;elastic&quot; and can apparently be reduced almost to vanishing point' (Jung
  1952: 435). Another of the ways in which Jung came to characterize synchronicity was
  therefore as `a psychically conditioned relativity of time and space' (Jung 1952: 435). In
  fact, Jung suggests that spatio-temporal relativity of this kind is the basic condition
  within the unconscious psyche, as though space and time `did not exist in themselves but
  were only &quot;postulated&quot; by the conscious mind' (Jung 1952: 435). Knowledge of
  events at a distance or in the future is possible because, within the unconscious psyche,
  all events co-exist timelessly and spacelessly:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">For the unconscious psyche space and time seem to be relative; that is to say,
      knowledge finds itself in a space-time continuum in which space is no longer space, nor
      time time. If, therefore, the unconscious should develop or maintain a potential in the
      direction of consciousness, it is then possible for parallel events to be perceived or
      `known'. (Jung 1952: 481)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This space-time relativity is different from the notion of qualitative time. In
  qualitative time the idea of a `moment', and hence of relative simultaneity, is of
  paramount importance. In space-time relativity any natural understanding of `moments', and
  certainly of simultaneity, becomes irrelevant, as the experience of foreknowledge clearly
  indicates.</p>
  <p align="justify">Apart from experimental confirmation of this crucial insight concerning space-time
  relativity, Rhine's work also appeared to support Jung's observation that paranormal
  experiences are usually attended by heightened emotionality. For Rhine's work identified
  the so-called `decline effect', the fact that the most significant results were generally
  obtained towards the beginning of the experimental session when the subject's interest
  (emotional engagement) can be supposed to have been at its greatest (Jung 1952: 434,
  436--7).</p>
  <p align="justify">On Rhine's initiative, a correspondence between him and Jung developed which continued
  intermittently from 1934 to 1954. Rhine repeatedly pressed Jung to write down accounts of
  his paranormal experiences and observations as well as his theoretical reflections
  concerning them (see Jung 1973: 180--2, 378--9). Though somewhat reluctant, because
  fearing incomprehension on the part of the public (Jung 1973: 190), Jung did comply to a
  certain extent and in a letter of November 1945 gave in response to a series of direct
  questions submitted by Rhine a tentative preliminary formulation of the theory of
  synchronicity as he would eventually present it in terms of the psychic relativization of
  space and time (Jung 1973: 493--5).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Physics">P</a>hysics</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's language in discussing the implications of Rhine's experiments -- his references
  to `relativity' and a `space-time continuum' -- is clearly reminiscent of Einstein's
  theories of relativity in physics, and in fact the influence of Einstein on Jung is a real
  and substantial one. When the physicist was working in Zurich in 1909 and 1912, he was
  Jung's dinner guest on several occasions, and, as Jung recalls, `tried to instil into us
  the elements of [his first theory of relativity], more or less successfully' (Jung 1976:
  109; see also Jung 1935: 67--8). Jung continues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">It was Einstein who first started me off thinking about a possible relativity of time
      as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than thirty years later this
      stimulus led to my relation with the physicist Professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of
      psychic synchronicity. (Jung 1976: 109; see also Progoff 1989: 151--2)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Perhaps an even more significant influence on Jung were certain developments within the
  other great physics theory that arose in the early part of the twentieth century: quantum
  mechanics. Jung was impressed by both the principle of complementarity formulated by Niels
  Bohr and the ability to predict subatomic events only probabilistically. It was to the
  legitimacy of mere probabilistic prediction that Jung most often appealed in support of
  his concept of acausality. With reference to one such subatomic event, radioactive decay,
  he quotes Sir James Jeans: `Radioactive break-up appeared to be an effect without a cause,
  and suggested that the ultimate laws of nature were not even causal' (in Jung 1952: 512).</p>
  <p align="justify">The principle of complementarity was utilized by Jung in his presentation of the status
  of synchronicity. Bohr considered that one of the central paradoxes of quantum physics --
  the fact that subatomic entities behave in contradictory ways, either as particle or as
  wave, depending on the method by which they are observed -- cannot be resolved by
  considering one of the forms of manifestation more essential than the other. Both, in his
  view, are fundamental: the two forms of manifestation <u>complement</u> each other and
  together give as complete a picture of the actual subatomic entity as is possible given
  the intrinsic limitations of human cognition (see, e.g., Honner 1987). Jung saw causality
  and acausality as standing in a similar relationship. As the title of his principal essay
  indicates, synchronicity is for him `an acausal connecting principle'. As such, it is `a
  hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation' (Jung 1952:
  435). It is `equal in rank' precisely in the sense of being complementary to the principle
  of causality: causality accounts for one kind of connection between events -- `constant
  connection through effect', as Jung epitomizes it (Jung 1952: 514) -- and synchronicity
  accounts for the complementary kind of connection -- `inconstant connection through
  contingency, equivalence, or &quot;meaning&quot;' (Jung 1952: 514). Together, the two
  principles give, in Jung's view, a complete account of the kinds of connections that can
  exist between events. Jung also draws attention to the complementarities between
  consciousness and the unconscious and between physics and psychology (Jung 1947/1954:
  231--2).</p>
  <p align="justify">The implications of these points from physics were explored by Jung largely through his
  friendship with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, which lasted from 1932 until Pauli's death
  in 1958. The full extent of Pauli's and Jung's influence on each other has only recently
  begun to be evaluated (see, e.g., Erkelens 1991; Meier 1992; Zabriskie 1995; Lindorff
  1995a and 1995b). One can note in particular that Jung's principal essay on synchronicity
  was originally published in the same volume as a companion essay by Pauli on `The
  Influence of Archetypal Ideas on the Scientific Theories of Kepler' (Jung and Pauli 1955).
  In his own essay Jung credits Pauli with having helped him formulate the <u>quaternio</u>
  diagram in which the complementary relationships between causality and synchronicity and
  between indestructible energy and the space-time continuum were set out (Jung 1952: 514).
  Indeed, Pauli himself appears to have been particularly prone to experiencing
  synchronicities, especially of the psychokinetic variety, and discussed them in detail in
  his letters to Jung (Hinshaw 1995: 129--30). Furthermore, in a letter to the physicist M.
  Fierz (22 June 1949) Jung actually refers to a draft of one of his essays on synchronicity
  as a `manuscript which Pauli has prompted me to write' (Jung 1973: 530).</p>
<b>
</b>
  <p align="justify"><b><a name="Synchronicity">T</a>HE THEORY OF SYNCHRONICITY</b> </p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's various thoughts on synchronicity converged from these diverse sources and were
  integrated in two essays: `On Synchronicity', originally delivered as a lecture at the
  1951 Eranos Conference, and `Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle', a vastly
  expanded version of the 1951 paper, originally published in 1952 alongside an essay by
  Pauli in <u>The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche</u> (English translation 1955).
  The 1951 essay, contained in the present volume, is probably Jung's clearest piece of
  writing on this subject, but because of its brevity it inevitably skips over many
  difficulties and implications. The 1952 essay, by contrast, is replete with so many
  difficulties and nuances that it ends up seeming rather confused and so risks doing poor
  justice to the important ideas it contains. Although this essay is not included in the
  present volume, almost all of its central ideas do figure in one form or another in the
  ensuing selections. It may therefore be useful, before addressing the key issues of the
  theory, to give a summary of the core argument of this essay.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="SACP">`</a>Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle'</u></p>
  <p align="justify">In his `Foreword' (Jung 1952: 419--20) Jung states that he is aiming `to give a
  consistent account of everything I have to say on this subject'. In the first chapter,
  `Exposition' (Jung 1952: 421--58), he notes that modern physics has shown natural laws to
  be statistical truths and the principle of causality to be only relatively valid, so that
  at the microphysical (i.e., subatomic) level there can occur events which are acausal. He
  then addresses the question of whether acausal events can also be demonstrated at the
  macrophysical level of everyday experience. The most decisive evidence in support of this
  possibility he considers to have been provided by Rhine's experiments. These experiments
  have revealed statistically significant correlations between events in spite of the fact
  that the possibility of any known kind of energy transmission and hence of causal
  relationship between the events was completely ruled out. Jung thereby concludes that
  under certain psychic conditions time and space can both become relative and can even
  appear to be transcended altogether. The fact that Rhine's positive results fell off once
  his subjects began to lose interest suggests to Jung that the necessary psychic condition
  has to do with affectivity. Affectivity in turn suggests the presence of an activated
  archetype, and in fact this archetypal background is especially evident in the kind of
  spontaneous acausal events Jung encountered in his therapeutic work. In these spontaneous
  cases, however, a certain amount of symbolic interpretation is often needed in order to
  detect the operation of the archetype. Jung is now in a position to define synchronicity,
  which he does in a variety of ways (see below, subsection on `Time'). He also suggests a
  possible psychological dynamic to explain how an activated archetype might result in
  synchronicities: the presence of the active archetype is accompanied by numinous effects,
  and this numinosity or affectivity results in a lowering of the mental level, a relaxing
  of the focus of consciousness. As the energy of consciousness is lowered, the energy of
  the unconscious is correspondingly heightened, so that a gradient from the unconscious to
  the conscious is established and unconscious contents flow into consciousness more readily
  than usual. Included among these unconscious contents are items of what Jung calls
  `absolute knowledge', knowledge that transcends the space-time limitations of
  consciousness in the manner demonstrated by Rhine's experiments. If there is then the
  recognition of a parallel between any of this `absolute knowledge' and co-occurring outer
  physical events, the result will be the experience of synchronicity. Finally in this
  chapter, Jung discusses a number of mantic procedures and concludes that astrology is the
  one most suitable for his purposes, which are to yield measurable results demonstrating
  the existence of synchronicity and to provide insight into the psychic background of
  synchronicity.</p>
  <p align="justify">The second chapter, `An Astrological Experiment' (Jung 1952: 459--84), describes Jung's
  attempt to carry out these aims. He collected and analyzed 483 pairs of marriage
  horoscopes (obtained from friendly donors) in three batches of 180, 220, and 83, looking
  for conjunctions and oppositions of sun, moon, ascendant, descendant, Mars, and Venus. He
  found that the maximal figure for each of the three batches was one of the traditional
  aspects for marriage (moon conjunct sun, moon conjunct moon, or moon conjunct ascendant).
  Although the figures do not exceed the kind of dispersions that might be expected due to
  chance, Jung considers it psychologically interesting that they appear to confirm
  astrological expectation; moreover, if the probabilities of the three individual sets of
  results are combined, the overall result does become statistically significant. In Jung's
  view, his results fortuitously imitate astrological expectation and therefore constitute a
  synchronistic phenomenon. The archetypal background to this synchronicity he finds
  indicated by the lively interest taken in the experiment by himself and his co-worker.
  Rejecting as primitive and regressive the hypothesis of magical causality, he concludes
  that if the connecting principle between astrological expectation and the results obtained
  is not causal, it must consist in meaning.</p>
  <p align="justify">This conclusion is supported in the third chapter, `Forerunners of the Idea of
  Synchronicity' (Jung 1952: 485--504). Jung surveys a range of traditional views --
  Oriental and Western; primitive, classical, medieval and Renaissance -- which express the
  possibility of there being a realm of transcendental, objective, or `self-subsistent'
  meaning. In particular, he looks at the notions of Tao, microcosm and macrocosm, sympathy,
  correspondence, and pre-established harmony. He also notes that the idea of
  self-subsistent meaning is sometimes suggested in dreams.</p>
  <p align="justify">In the fourth and final chapter, `Conclusion' (Jung 1952: 505--19), Jung acknowledges
  that his views concerning synchronicity have not been proved, but he nevertheless suggests
  tentatively, on the basis of observations of out-of-the-body and near-death experiences,
  that the relationship between mind and body may yet prove to be one of synchronicity. He
  then elaborates on the theoretical status of synchronicity as a fourth explanatory
  principle, one in addition to time, space, and causality (or in addition to indestructible
  energy, the space-time continuum, and causality). According to Jung, synchronicity `makes
  possible a whole judgment' (Jung 1952: 512) by introducing the `psychoid factor' (Jung
  1952: 513) of meaning into one's description of nature. It thereby also helps bring about
  a rapprochement between psychology and physics. More specifically, the psychoid factor at
  the basis of synchronicity is the archetype -- a factor which Jung proceeds to
  characterize. Archetypes provide the shared meaning by virtue of which two events are
  considered to be in a relationship of synchronicity. They cannot be determined with
  precision and are capable of expressing themselves in physical as well as psychic
  processes. They manifest their meaning through whatever psychic and physical content is
  available, but might equally well have manifested the same meaning through other content.
  They represent psychic probability, making it likely that certain types of events will
  occur but not enabling one actually to predict the occurrence of any particular event. At
  this point Jung introduces the broader category of general acausal orderedness, of which
  meaningful coincidence experiences are considered to be one particular instance. He states
  in conclusion that general acausal orderedness (which includes such phenomena as the
  properties of natural numbers and the discontinuities of modern physics) is a universal
  factor existing from all eternity, whereas meaningful coincidences are individual acts of
  creation in time. Both, however, are synchronistic phenomena occurring within the field of
  the contingent.</p>
  <p align="justify">As can be seen from this summary, the essential concepts running through the argument
  of the 1952 essay are time, acausality, meaning, and probability, with the final chapter
  also highlighting the mind-body relationship, the notion of general acausal orderedness,
  and the question of the epistemological status of the principle of synchronicity.
  Clarification of Jung's thinking on each of these key topics should make it possible to
  move through his various writings on synchronicity much more confidently and profitably.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Time">T</a>ime</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's definitions of synchronicity confront one with an immediate puzzle. Almost
  invariably, they highlight the factor of simultaneity, and yet one important category of
  events which Jung wants to call synchronistic -- namely, precognitive experiences -- by
  definition cannot be simultaneous. Jung himself was certainly aware of this apparent
  contradiction and made an interesting, if ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to resolve it.</p>
  <p align="justify">In his 1951 Eranos lecture he offers a definition which recognizes three categories of
  events to which the term synchronicity can be applied. The first category includes
  happenings such as the scarab incident where a psychic event (the patient's recalling her
  dream of a scarab) and a physical event (the actual appearance of a scarabaeid beetle)
  occur at the same time and in the same place (during the analytic session in Jung's
  consulting room). Here there is indeed simultaneity between the psychic and physical
  events (Jung 1951b: 526).</p>
  <p align="justify">The second category includes happenings where a psychic event occurs and a
  corresponding physical event takes place more or less simultaneously but at a distance, so
  that the approximate simultaneity can only be established afterwards (Jung 1951b: 526).
  Jung cites as an illustration Emanuel Swedenborg's well-attested vision of the great fire
  in Stockholm in 1759. Swedenborg was at a party in Gottenburg about two hundred miles from
  Stockholm when the vision occurred. He told his companions at six o'clock in the evening
  that the fire had started, then described its course over the next two hours, exclaiming
  in relief at eight o'clock that it had at last been extinguished, just three doors from
  his own house. All these details were confirmed when messengers arrived in Gottenburg from
  Stockholm over the next few days (Jung 1952: 481, 483).</p>
  <p align="justify">The third category includes happenings where a psychic event occurs and a corresponding
  physical event takes place in the future. Here there is not even approximate simultaneity
  (Jung 1951b: 526). An example mentioned by Jung is of a student friend of his whose father
  had promised him a trip to Spain if he passed his final examinations satisfactorily. The
  friend then had a dream of seeing various things in a Spanish city: a particular square, a
  Gothic Cathedral, and, around a certain corner, a carriage drawn by two cream-coloured
  horses. Shortly afterwards, having successfully passed his examinations, he actually
  visited Spain for the first time and encountered all the details from his dream in reality
  (Jung 1951b: 522).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's emphasis is generally on the first of these categories. He presents the scarab
  incident as a paradigm case (Jung 1951b: 526) and tries to assimilate the second and third
  categories to its basic pattern by writing that `In groups 2 and 3 the coinciding events
  are not yet present in the observer's field of perception, but have been anticipated in
  time' (Jung 1951b: 526) -- in other words, they are present to consciousness as though
  actually being perceived (see also Jaff 1967: 270--1).</p>
  <p align="justify">When Jung elaborates his thoughts in the 1952 essay, he introduces an important
  additional factor: a second psychic state (Jung 1952: 441--5). After first speaking, as in
  the 1951 essay, of the simultaneity of psychic and physical events (Jung 1952: 441), he
  later shifts to speaking of `the simultaneous occurrence of two different psychic states'
  (Jung 1952: 444). He explains that `One of them is the normal, probable state (i.e., the
  one that is causally explicable), and the other, the critical experience, is the one that
  cannot be causally derived from the first' (Jung 1952: 444--5). If one wonders what has
  happened here to the physical event, it is understood as the `objective existence' (Jung
  1952: 445) of the `critical' psychic event. Jung is now claiming that the synchronicity
  actually consists of the coincidence not between the critical psychic event and its
  objective correlate but between the two psychic events: `An unexpected content which is
  directly or indirectly connected with some objective external event coincides with the
  ordinary psychic state: this is what I call synchronicity' (Jung 1952: 445). For instance,
  in the apparently precognitive experience of Jung's student friend, the `unexpected
  content' is the dream of the Spanish city with its square, its cathedral, and its carriage
  drawn by cream-coloured horses, while the `objective external event' with which the
  content is `directly or indirectly connected' is the fact of seeing these things in
  reality. The `ordinary psychic state' -- the new presence in the definition -- we must
  suppose to be the ongoing state of mind of the student at the time of his dream. It is
  this ordinary state which is simultaneous with the unexpected content of the dream and
  which Jung, rather surprisingly, says `coincides' with it.</p>
  <p align="justify">This thinking receives unambiguous expression in the definition of synchronicity that
  occurs in the `Rsum' added to the 1955 English translation of the principal essay.
  With the specific aim of clearing up misunderstandings that had arisen, Jung writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">By synchronicity I mean the occurrence of a <u>meaningful coincidence in time</u>. It
      can take three forms:</p>
      <p align="justify">a) The coincidence of a certain psychic content with a corresponding objective process
      which is perceived to take place simultaneously.</p>
      <p align="justify">b) The coincidence of a subjective psychic state with a phantasm (dream or vision)
      which later turns out to be a more or less faithful reflection of a `synchronistic',
      objective event that took place more or less simultaneously, but at a distance.</p>
      <p align="justify">c) The same, except that the event perceived takes place in the future and is
      represented in the present only by a phantasm that corresponds to it.</p>
      <p align="justify">Whereas in the first case an objective event coincides with a subjective content, the
      synchronicity in the other two cases can only be verified subsequently, though the
      synchronistic event as such is formed by the coincidence of a neutral psychic state with a
      phantasm (dream or vision). (Jung 1955: 144--5)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This definition is clearly similar to the three-pronged 1951 definition summarized
  earlier. Now, however, instead of the coincidence in the second and third cases being
  between a psychic state and an objective external event which has been `anticipated in
  time', it is between one psychic state and another psychic state (a `phantasm') which is
  `a more or less faithful reflection' of an objective external event.</p>
  <p align="justify">For Jung's purposes, the advantage of introducing the normal psychic state is that it
  allows him to retain the notion of simultaneity in the case of each of his three
  categories of synchronicity, for in each case there is both a normal psychic state and an
  unexpected psychic content occurring simultaneously with it. The simultaneity of these two
  psychic states is not compromised no matter how great a separation there is either in
  space or in time between the unexpected psychic content and its corresponding objective
  external event. Referring to the occurrence of the unexpected contents which mark the
  actual synchronicities -- of whatever kind -- Jung maintains that `we are dealing with
  exactly the same category of events whether their objectivity appears separated from my
  consciousness in space or in time' (Jung 1952: 445).</p>
  <p align="justify">However, for all its advantage in terms of preserving simultaneity, this definition is
  itself fraught with problems. First, it means that there are now actually two acausal
  relationships involved in the synchronicity: that between the two psychic events (Jung
  1952: 444--5), and that between the second psychic event and the physical event with which
  it corresponds (Jung 1952: 447). Though Jung says of the two critical events -- the second
  psychic event and the physical event -- that `The one is as puzzling as the other' (Jung
  1952: 447), he nowhere shows explicit awareness of the fact that he is claiming they are
  both, in different respects, acausal.</p>
  <p align="justify">Second, any acausal relationship that may exist between the two psychic events will be
  virtually impossible to demonstrate. Since both events are intrapsychic, the possibility
  of there being some associative causal connection between them can scarcely be even
  improbable, let alone, as Jung requires, `unthinkable' (Jung 1952: 518). At any rate, it
  is not acausality of this kind, but of the kind between a psychic and a physical event,
  that Jung considered to have been so impressively demonstrated by Rhine's experiments.</p>
  <p align="justify">A third problem is that of identifying the neutral psychic state at all. For example,
  we are able only to guess about the normal psychic state simultaneously with which the
  student's dream of the Spanish city took place. In the light of Aziz's work, one might
  identify this normal psychic state with the conscious orientation of the experiencer (Aziz
  1990: 66) -- in the student's case, a state of anxiety concerning his impending
  examinations. The unexpected content which arises simultaneously with this conscious
  orientation would, according to Aziz, be an unconscious compensation serving the purposes
  of individuation (Aziz 1990: 66--7); the student's dream, for example, might have
  compensated his anxiety by impressing on him that he would indeed earn the trip to Spain
  by passing his examinations. This compensatory relationship between the two psychic events
  is indeed acausal in that the conscious orientation does not cause the compensation but
  only provides the conditions in which it might occur. Again, inasmuch as the compensatory
  relationship is involved ultimately in the furthering of individuation, it is also
  meaningful. However, even if this understanding proves workable up to a point, it also
  involves at least one notable discrepancy from Jung's explicit statements elsewhere: two
  psychic states in a compensatory relationship may be meaningfully related in terms of
  individuation, but they do not in any obvious sense have, as Jung specifies, `the same or
  a similar meaning' (Jung 1952: 441). If they did, the one would hardly be compensated by
  the other.</p>
  <p align="justify">As noted above, Jung's first theorizing about synchronicity was done with reference to
  astrology and the <u>I Ching</u> and focused on the fact that things arising in a
  particular moment of time all share the characteristics of that moment. It appears to have
  been this understanding of the role of time, an understanding in which simultaneity does
  indeed play an essential part, which led Jung to coin the term `synchronicity', with its
  emphasis on the element of time (Gk. <u>syn</u> = together, <u>chronos</u> = time). Later,
  Jung came to question the notion of qualitative time (Jung 1976: 176) and, under the
  influence of parapsychology and physics, began to emphasize instead the idea of the
  psychic relativization of space and time. That he nonetheless went to such lengths to
  uphold the component of simultaneity in the concept of synchronicity may have been because
  he wished to preserve enough of the original meaning of the concept to justify its
  continued use.</p>
  <p align="justify">In any case, it is clear that Jung would have done better to drop the notion of
  simultaneity altogether in relation to synchronistic experiences, and instead to have
  operated consistently with the more flexible notion of space-time relativization. He could
  in fact have done this and still highlighted the defining factor of time by giving more
  prominence to his characterization of synchronicities as `acts of creation in time' (Jung
  1952: 517), emphasizing their nature as spontaneous momentary states in contrast to
  constant or reproducible ones (see below on `general acausal orderedness').</p>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="Acausality">A</a>causality</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's personal paranormal experiences confronted him with events which seemed
  inexplicable in terms of normal physical and psychological causes. There was, for example,
  no apparent cause of the walnut table splitting or the bread knife shattering in a closed
  drawer. The impression Jung gained from events such as these, that normal causality was
  insufficient as a comprehensive principle of explanation, was later reinforced by the
  results of Rhine's experiments: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">since experience [i.e., Rhine's experimental work] has shown that under certain
      conditions space and time can be reduced almost to zero, causality disappears along with
      them, because causality is bound up with the existence of space and time and physical
      changes, and consists essentially in the succession of cause and effect. For this reason
      synchronistic phenomena cannot in principle be associated with any conceptions of
      causality. Hence the interconnection of meaningfully coincident factors must necessarily
      be thought of as acausal. (Jung 1952: 445--6)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Supporting these conclusions from another angle was Jung's cultural research into such
  pre-modern concepts as the `sympathy of all things' and `correspondences', and especially
  into the workings of the <u>I Ching</u>. This research made him aware of the fact that
  other kinds of connection than causality not only exist but have in fact received wide
  traditional recognition and been put to orderly cultural use.</p>
  <p align="justify">Usually, however, when Jung attempts to explain what he means by calling synchronicity
  an `acausal connecting principle', his first recourse is to the following argument based
  on quantum physics. `The discoveries of modern physics', he informs us, `... have
  shattered the absolute validity of natural law and made it relative' (Jung 1952: 421).
  Since `very small quantities [i.e., subatomic particles] no longer behave in accordance
  with natural laws', it follows that `natural laws are <u>statistical</u> truths' (Jung
  1952: 421). Further:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">The philosophical principle that underlies our conception of natural law is <u>causality</u>.
      But if the connection between cause and effect turns out to be only statistically valid
      and only relatively true, then the causal principle is only of relative use for explaining
      natural processes and therefore presupposes the existence of one or more other factors
      which would be necessary for an explanation. (Jung 1952: 421)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">This `other factor' is Jung's `acausal connecting principle'. He believes the above
  argument to have proved the existence of the principle in `the realm of very small
  quantities' (Jung 1952: 421). Regarding its existence in the realm normal sensory
  experience, he says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">We shall naturally look round in vain in the macrophysical world for acausal events,
      for the simple reason that we cannot imagine events that are connected non-causally and
      are capable of a non-causal explanation. But that does not mean that such events do not
      exist. Their existence -- or at least their possibility -- follows logically from the
      premise of statistical truth. (Jung 1952: 421--2)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Presumably Jung emphasized this argument from physics because it promised to give his
  concept of acausality the greatest degree of scientific respectability and the most
  fundamental level of epistemological grounding. However, it brings with it several
  problems of its own. For instance, the fact that Jung's understanding of causality and
  acausality is so closely tied to physics threatens to make it too restrictive. He himself
  clearly intended the notion of acausality to apply to psychological as well as to physical
  causes: synchronistic events are not caused by psychological states. Yet it is at least
  questionable whether physical terms alone are adequate to account for the dynamics of
  psychological causes. As John Beloff points out, `the concept of cause was not invented by
  physicists, physics is merely one of the domains for its application, the concept as such
  is a very basic logical notion of wide generality' (Beloff 1977: 577). In response to
  Jung's claim that Rhine's parapsychological data have furnished `decisive evidence for the
  existence of acausal combinations of events' (Jung 1952: 432), Beloff writes that it is
  `nonsensical to say ... that there are events that are related experimentally that are not
  related causally. For the crux of the experimental method is precisely carrying out
  certain procedures that we may call A so as to find out whether or not they are necessary
  in order to obtain a result B' (Beloff 1977: 577). If Rhine's experiments are indeed
  statistically significant and there is no way to account for them in normal causal terms,
  what they demonstrate, according to Beloff, is the existence not of absolute acausality
  but of some form of paranormal causality.</p>
  <p align="justify">Even if one finds reasons to differ from Beloff's understanding of causality, it
  remains the case that many broader conceptions than Jung's are both possible and have in
  fact been regularly invoked not only in the ancient world (e.g., Aristotle's material,
  efficient, formal, and final causes [Ross 1928]) but also in the modern period (e.g.,
  Sheldrake's hypothesis of formative causation [1981]), and not only in the West but also
  in the East (e.g., in Buddhist philosophy [see Kalupahana 1975]). Whether one evaluates
  Jung's concept of acausality favourably or critically, it is important to bear in mind the
  restricted understanding of causality on which it is based.</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's actual argument for acausality involves two stages. First, he argues that the
  inability of modern science to predict the behaviour of subatomic particles proves that
  the relationship between the particles is not simply causal but must also involve some
  element of acausality. Second, he argues that because this acausality exists in the
  microphysical world of subatomic particles, it ought also to exist in the macrophysical
  world of normal sensory experience. Both stages of the argument can be challenged.</p>
  <p align="justify">It is certainly the case that, in Jung's day and still at present, the behaviour of
  individual subatomic particles cannot be predicted other than probabilistically. But from
  this fact it does not necessarily follow that such behaviour involves an element of
  irreducible acausality. It is true that subatomic randomness may stem from acausality, but
  then again it may not. And even if it does, this is not because such randomness itself
  implies acausality. The acausal cannot simply be inferred from the merely probabilistic:
  if event A is followed by event B only seventy-five per cent of the time, this does not
  entail that B is not caused by A. In fact, since B, when it does occur, would not have
  done so but for A, it is reasonable to think that it has been caused by A.</p>
  <p align="justify">It is even possible that the behaviour of subatomic particles may turn out not to be
  irreducibly probabilistic but the result of deterministic factors which just happen to be
  too complex and subtle for scientists to discern at present. Since the emergence of chaos
  theory in the 1980s, it has become increasingly clear that apparently random or chaotic
  behaviour can be just as much the product of regular causal factors as is conspicuously
  ordered behaviour. As the mathematician Ian Stewart has remarked, some scientists now
  appreciate `the ability of even simple equations to generate motion so complex, so
  sensitive to measurement, that it appears random' (Stewart 1990: 16), so that they `are
  beginning to view order and chaos as two distinct manifestations of an underlying
  determinism' (Stewart 1990: 22). These considerations alone should make one wary of
  automatically discounting the operation of causality no matter how random and
  unpredictable certain behaviour appears.</p>
  <p align="justify">However, even without invoking chaos theory as such, a number of eminent physicists
  have been dissatisfied with the view which sees certain subatomic events as inescapably
  random and unpredictable. Einstein, for example, famously resisted the view of a universe
  in which `God plays dice', that is, allows things to happen by pure chance. He initiated a
  search for `hidden variables' -- as yet unknown factors which could account causally for
  the seemingly random behaviour of subatomic particles. More recently this approach was
  also pursued by David Bohm who stressed that his was a `causal interpretation' of quantum
  phenomena (Bohm 1990: 276--81). Even a contemporary physicist who personally considers
  that there are indeed quantum phenomena for which `both theory and experiment converge in
  making the prospect of a causal explanation ... exceedingly unlikely' (Mansfield 1995: 32)
  nonetheless cautions that `the key issues [in the acausality debate] are not yet fully
  resolved' (Mansfield 1995: 80).</p>
  <p align="justify">Let us suppose, however, that certain events at the subatomic level are genuinely
  acausal. Even so, the next stage of Jung's argument -- that there must also be acausal
  events in the macrophysical world -- does not follow, as he puts it, `logically from the
  premise of statistical truth' (Jung 1952: 422). There is no reason to expect that a
  property existing on the subatomic level will also exist in the realm of normal sensory
  experience. Perhaps what Jung had in mind was that the subatomic indeterminacy which he
  thought implied acausality could in some way be expected to be scaled up to the level of
  normal experience. If so, the very way in which probability operates in fact suggests the
  contrary: the indeterminacy attaching to an individual event on one scale will
  progressively diminish as one views ever larger aggregates of such events on a higher
  scale. Acausality on the subatomic level cannot prove or even make probable its existence
  on other levels. What it can do, however, is to make its possible existence on those
  higher levels less intellectually outrageous (cf. Mansfield 1995: 50).</p>
  <p align="justify">Problematic though the concept of acausality is, it is certainly not an incoherent or
  absurd notion. There is strong, if not conclusive, evidence that acausality does indeed
  exist on the subatomic level, and there are no <u>a priori</u> reasons that it should not
  also exist on the level of normal sensory experience. On the normal sensory level it may
  not be possible actually to prove either its existence as understood by Jung or the
  inappropriateness of explaining it in terms of broader conceptions of causality than
  Jung's. Granted this limitation, a case remains for speaking of acausality in a relative
  and provisional sense, as applying to the relationship between events within a certain
  domain of consideration or level of current understanding (see Main 1996: 40--3, 154--5).
  As the paranormal events experienced and observed by Jung indicate, acausality appears to
  be an accurate enough term phenomenologically. As his definitions of synchronicity also
  emphasize, it is an extremely useful concept psychologically inasmuch as it shifts
  attention away from the causes of events and onto their possible meaning.</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify">Meaning</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Rather surprisingly, Jung nowhere sets out systematically his thoughts concerning what
  actually makes synchronicities meaningful. He does, however, provide a substantial clue to
  his implicit understanding when he states that `by far the greatest number of
  synchronistic phenomena that I have had occasion to observe and analyse can easily be
  shown to have a direct connection with the archetype' (Jung 1952: 481). Though he appears
  to recognize not one but several kinds of meaning that can adhere to synchronicities, all
  of these can ultimately be related back to the single factor of the archetype. Aziz, for
  example, has identified four levels of meaning referred to by Jung at different times.
  These are: (1) simply the fact of two or more events paralleling one another (the
  paralleling is by virtue of a shared content or meaning); (2) the emotional charge or
  `numinosity' attending the synchronicity (a source of non-rational meaning); (3) the
  significance of the synchronicity interpreted subjectively, from the point of view of the
  experiencer's personal needs and goals; and (4) the significance of the synchronicity
  objectively, as the expression of archetypal meaning which is transcendental to human
  consciousness (Aziz 1990: 64--6, 75--84; see also Main 1996: 155--79).</p>
  <p align="justify">Aziz calls this fourth level of meaning the `archetypal level' (Aziz 1990: 66). It is
  based on the fact that the archetype represents in itself a form of meaning which is `<u>a
  priori</u> in relation to human consciousness and apparently exists outside man' (Jung
  1952: 501--2). Thus in synchronicities `one and the same (transcendental) meaning might
  manifest itself simultaneously in the human psyche and in the arrangement of an external
  and independent event' (Jung 1952: 482). In fact, each of the other three levels of
  meaning also depends on the presence of the archetype. The shared meaning by virtue of
  which two or more events are taken to be in a synchronistic relationship derives from an
  archetype (e.g., underlying the scarab symbol in both its psychic and its physical
  appearances is the archetype of rebirth). Again, the numinous charge of synchronicities
  derives from the presence of an activated archetype -- the association with such
  numinosity being precisely one of the characteristics of archetypes as presented by Jung
  (Jung 1952: 436). Third, the subjective level of meaning, insofar as this is evaluated
  with reference to the process of individuation, will also be based on archetypes, since it
  is the archetypes -- shadow, animus/anima, self, etc. -- which essentially govern
  individuation for Jung.</p>
  <p align="justify">The appreciation of this archetypal foundation of synchronicities helps resolve a
  pervasive ambiguity in Jung's use of the phrase `meaningful coincidence'. On the one hand,
  the `meaning' referred to in this phrase is clearly the significance the coincidence has
  for the experiencer -- ultimately, its bearing on the experiencer's individuation. On the
  other hand, Jung also often uses the word `meaning' to refer to the content that the
  coinciding events have in common: they have `the same or similar meaning' or `appear as
  meaningful parallels' (Jung 1952: 441). Here what the coincidence might signify for an
  experiencer is not germane; one can, in fact, replace `meaning' with `content'. It is true
  that the two senses of `meaning' do not exclude each other -- the meaning/content can be
  meaningful/significant to an experiencer or observer -- but it is equally true that they
  do not entail each other. That Jung nonetheless moves ambiguously between the two
  different senses probably stems from the fact that for him the content of synchronicities
  is generally understood to be archetypal and therefore is bound also to be meaningful in
  the sense of significant.</p>
  <p align="justify">The tension between the two understandings of `meaning' is clearest in the case of
  parapsychological experiments such as those of Rhine. In these experiments what is
  important is primarily the paralleling of content between the image constituting the
  subject's guess and the target object. It is this paralleling of content which leads Jung
  to assert that `Rhine's results confront us with the fact that there are events which are
  related to one another experimentally, and in this case <u>meaningfully</u>, without there
  being any possibility of proving that this relation is a causal one ...' (Jung 1952: 435).
  Whether the coincidence represented by the improbable number of successful guesses is also
  meaningful in the sense of being significant for the individuation or other personal needs
  or goals of the experimental subject is a question about which Jung appears to have
  remained uncertain. On the one hand, he acknowledges that Rhine's experiments `contain no
  direct evidence of any constellation of the archetype' (Jung 1952: 440; see also Jung
  1976: 399). On the other hand, he suggests that such a constellation may nonetheless be
  present inasmuch as `the experimental set-up is influenced by the expectation of a <u>miracle</u>'
  and `A miracle is an archetypal situation' (Jung 1976: 537; see also Progoff 1987:
  105--6). Furthermore, the important emotional factor in the experiments, indicated by the
  decline effect, may also suggest the presence of an archetypal situation inasmuch as
  archetypal situations are typically `accompanied by a corresponding emotion' (Jung 1976:
  537).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="AstrologicalExperiment">J</a>ung's astrological experiment</u></p>
  <p align="justify">The section of Jung's 1952 essay on synchronicity which was most widely misunderstood
  when it first appeared was his astrological experiment. Indeed, many writers on
  synchronicity still tend to side-step this aspect of his work, dismissing it as, for
  example, `peripheral' (Aziz 1990: 2) or `fruitless' (Mansfield 1995: 33). Others, however,
  have found Jung's experiment to constitute one of the most interesting and original
  features of his work and to have suggestive implications for the understanding both of
  statistics (Fordham 1957) and of astrology (Hyde 1992).</p>
  <p align="justify">It may be that Jung himself was unclear initially as to what his experiment could be
  expected to demonstrate. Michael Fordham writes that `At one time [Jung] really thought
  that if his [astrological] material proved statistically significant it would prove his
  [synchronicity] thesis' (Fordham 1993: 105) -- a suggestion reinforced by Jung's remark in
  a letter to B.&nbsp;V. Raman (6 September 1947) that `What I miss in astrological
  literature is chiefly the statistical method by which fundamental facts could be
  scientifically established' (Jung 1973: 476; see also Hyde 1992: 129--30). Later, however,
  Jung was adamant that his experiment, as carried out, was never intended to prove anything
  about astrology or, through astrology, about synchronicity (Jung 1958a: 494, 497, 498). He
  had come to appreciate, Fordham suggests, that if the astrological material did prove
  statistically significant, `it would make a cause for the data more likely' (Fordham 1993:
  105), thereby undermining the synchronicity thesis. Rather, what Jung hoped was that his
  experiment would `on the one hand demonstrate the existence of synchronicity [i.e., allow
  for its occurrence and make it visible in the form of measurable results] and, on the
  other hand, disclose psychic contents which would at least give us a clue to the nature of
  the psychic factor involved' (Jung 1952: 450). Arguably, he succeeded in both aims.</p>
  <p align="justify">The key to an appreciation of the experiment is an understanding of Jung's use of
  statistics -- a use which, as Fordham has remarked, is `highly original and peculiarly his
  own' (Fordham 1957: 36). As they are usually employed, Fordham explains,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">Statistics distinguish between two sets of phenomena: those which are sufficiently
      ordered to indicate causal connections and to which the notion of prediction can be
      applied with considerable success, and those whose action is random and which as such obey
      the laws of chance where the notion of prediction is of little use. (Fordham 1957: 36)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">With synchronicities, however, Jung introduces a third set of phenomena, since
  `Considered statistically they will appear as chance, but they will not be due to chance;
  i.e. he cuts right across the duality chance-cause axiom on which statistics are based'
  (Fordham 1957: 36). Statistically, events are considered to be `significant' (i.e., not
  chance) if their improbability rises above a certain level (technically, the `Null
  hypothesis'). When they rise above this level of improbability, events are usually
  expected and found to have a cause. Since none of Jung's astrological results rose to such
  a level, they were unlikely to have been caused but were indeed chance happenings -- which
  is what, as acausal events, he needed them to be. Thus, Jung's use of statistics `had an
  aim exactly the reverse to the usual one. He used them to define the region in which
  synchronistic phenomena are most likely' (Fordham 1957: 37).</p>
  <p align="justify">Rather than dismiss his results altogether because they did not rise to the level of
  statistical significance, Jung took the novel step of using the statistical distribution
  they presented as a monitor through which to investigate their possible psychological
  significance. As he remarks: `it is just as important to consider the exceptions to the
  rule as the averages.... Inasmuch as chance maxima and minima occur, they are <u>facts</u>
  whose nature I set out to explore' (Jung 1952: 463).</p>
  <p align="justify">Thus analysis of the three batches of 180, 220, and 83 pairs of marriage horoscopes
  showed the maximum frequencies to fall on the aspects respectively of moon conjunct sun,
  moon conjunct moon, and moon conjunct Ascendant. These are precisely the three aspects
  that astrological tradition would expect to turn up most frequently in marriage
  horoscopes, as Jung and his co-worker well knew (Jung 1952: 454--5). Here, however, they
  have turned up in a way which is entirely random. The horoscopes `were piled up in
  chronological order just as the post brought them in' (Jung 1952: 459), and Jung decided
  when to begin analyzing the first batch for no better reason than that he was unable to
  restrain his curiosity any longer (Jung 1958a: 495). As his subsequent analyses
  demonstrated, if the horoscopes had arrived in a different order or if he had waited until
  they had all come in and had analyzed them together, the three traditional marriage
  aspects would not have shown up with the same remarkable salience (Jung 1952: 479--80,
  471--2). He concludes that, since the resulting figures</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">actually fall within the limits of chance expectation, they do not support the
      astrological claim, they merely <u>imitate</u> accidentally the ideal answer to
      astrological expectation. It is nothing but a chance result from the statistical point of
      view, yet it is <u>meaningful</u> on account of the fact that it looks as if it validated
      this expectation. It is just what I call a synchronistic phenomenon. (Jung 1952: 477)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">The fact that the result corresponded to the expectations of his co-worker and himself
  suggested to Jung that their psychic state might in some way have been involved in
  `arranging' it, that there may have existed, in their case as with practitioners in the
  past, `a secret, mutual connivance ... between the material and the psychic state of the
  astrologer' (Jung 1952: 478). This conclusion was further suggested by his realization
  that in working on the statistics `use had been made of unconscious deception', that he
  had been `put off the trail by a number of errors' (Jung 1952: 478). The curious thing
  about these errors was that they `<u>all tend[ed] to exaggerate the results in a way
  favourable to astrology</u>, and add[ed] most suspiciously to the impression of an
  artificial or fraudulent arrangement of the facts' (Jung 1952: 479). Jung remarks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">I know, however, from long experience of these things that spontaneous synchronistic
      phenomena draw the observer, by hook or by crook, into what is happening and occasionally
      make him an accessory to the deed. That is the danger inherent in all parapsychological
      experiments. (Jung 1952: 479)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Fortunately, the errors in the astrological experiment were discovered in time and
  corrected (Jung 1952: 478). However, in the light both of these errors and of the
  remarkable correspondence between his expectation and the results he obtained, Jung
  conducted a further experiment to test for indications of possible psychic participation.
  He got three people `whose psychological status was accurately known' (Jung 1952: 473) to
  draw by lot twenty pairs of marriage horoscopes from a random assortment of 200. In each
  case, he found that the person's random selection of twenty horoscopes produced maximal
  figures which, while not statistically significant, corresponded surprisingly well with
  the known psychic state of the subject (Jung 1952: 473--5). For example, one woman `who,
  at the time of the experiment, found herself in a state of intense emotional excitement'
  drew horoscopes in which there was `a predominance of the Mars aspects' (Jung 1952: 474).
  Inasmuch as `The classical significance of Mars lies in his emotionality', this result
  `fully agrees with the psychic state of the subject' (Jung 1952: 474). This informal
  experiment appeared to confirm what had happened under more rigorously controlled
  circumstances in the main experiment. Without exceeding the levels of dispersion that
  would be expected due to chance, the data nonetheless patterned themselves in ways which
  corresponded to a known psychic disposition. If, however, the astrologer's psychic
  condition can indeed participate in the arrangement of the material being considered, this
  means that astrology may be more a form of divination and less a form of science than many
  of its practitioners would like to believe. This conclusion has in fact been drawn by some
  astrologers and has led to a serious reassessment of their practice (see Hyde 1992).</p>

<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="MindBody">T</a>he mind-body relationship</u></p>
  <p align="justify">The relationship between mind and body is a source of unending perplexity for
  physicians, psychologists, and philosophers alike. Jung states a version of the problem as
  follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">The assumption of a causal relation between psyche and physis leads ... to conclusions
      which it is difficult to square with experience: either there are physical processes which
      cause psychic happenings, or there is a pre-existent psyche which organizes matter. In the
      first case it is hard to see how chemical processes can ever produce psychic processes,
      and in the second case one wonders how an immaterial psyche could ever set matter in
      motion. (Jung 1952: 505--6)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">He then suggests, ambitiously, that `The synchronicity principle possesses properties
  that may help to clear up the body-soul problem' (Jung 1952: 506). The properties in
  question are the fact that the psyche can be meaningfully correlated with physical
  processes without any causal interaction -- suggesting that the psyche may not need to be
  connected with the brain (Jung 1952: 505); and the hypothesis of `absolute knowledge ... a
  knowledge not mediated by the sense organs' which provides the means by which this acausal
  co-ordination of mental and bodily processes can be possible (Jung 1952: 506).</p>
  <p align="justify">In the light of this suggestion Jung examines a number of cases of out-of-the-body and
  near-death experiences (Jung 1952: 506--9) which, he concludes, `seem to show that in
  swoon states, where by all human standards there is every guarantee that conscious
  activity and sense perception are suspended, consciousness, reproducible ideas, acts of
  judgment, and perceptions can still continue to exist' (Jung 1952: 509). He considers this
  to `indicate a shift in the localization of consciousness, a sort of separation from the
  body, or from the cerebral cortex or cerebrum which is conjectured to be the seat of
  conscious phenomena' (Jung 1952: 509). There now seem to be two possibilities: either
  `there is some other nervous substrate in us, apart from the cerebrum, that can think and
  perceive' or else `the psychic processes that go on in us during loss of consciousness are
  synchronistic phenomena, i.e., events which have no causal connection with organic
  processes' (Jung 1952: 509). Since there is evidence to support both possibilities (Jung
  1952: 510--11), Jung remains uncommitted, concluding that `psychophysical parallelism', by
  which he here seems to mean the mind-body relationship, is something `which we cannot at
  present pretend to understand' (Jung 1952: 511; cf. Jung 1973: 76--7).</p>
  <p align="justify">In the same period in which Jung was articulating his theory of synchronicity he was
  also giving serious thought to the possibility of there being a `subtle body' that somehow
  mediates between the psyche and the physical body as we normally experience them (see,
  e.g., Jung 1973: 522--3; Jung 1976: 43--5). Quite what the implications of this are for
  the theory of synchronicity is unclear. Jung's colleague C.&nbsp;A. Meier, for instance,
  considered psychosomatic phenomena to be synchronistic and as such actually to presuppose
  the existence of the subtle body (Meier 1963: 116). Another colleague, however,
  Marie-Louise von Franz, argued that psychosomatic phenomena and other suggestions of the
  existence of a subtle body indicate rather a causal relationship between mind and body
  (Franz 1992: 249--51). In support of her view she refers to Jung's intriguing suggestion
  -- which he admitted was `highly speculative, in fact unwarrantably adventurous' (Jung
  1976: 45) -- that the psyche and the body should be viewed as different manifestations of
  a single energy and their relationship be understood in terms of the transformation of
  this energy into greater or lesser states of `intensification' (Jung 1976: 45).</p>

<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="GeneralAcausalOrderedness">G</a>eneral acausal orderedness</u></p>
  <p align="justify">Synchronicities such as Jung's scarab case -- presented by him as paradigmatic --
  typically manifest themselves as random one-off events. However, certain kinds of acausal
  phenomena display a greater regularity than this. The results of Rhine's parapsychological
  experiments were sufficiently reproducible to achieve a high level of statistical
  significance (see Jung 1952: 516). Also, with mantic methods such as astrology and the <u>I
  Ching</u> Jung writes that `Synchronistic phenomena are found to occur -- experimentally
  -- with some degree of regularity and frequency' (Jung 1952: 511). Again, if the mind-body
  relationship were found to be synchronistic -- and Jung is at least open to this
  possibility -- then this too would imply that acausality is not just `a relatively rare
  phenomenon' (Jung 1952: 500, n.&nbsp;70). Above all, however, the conception of
  synchronicity as having to do solely with irregular one-off events was called into
  question for Jung by such factors as the properties of natural numbers and certain quantum
  phenomena such as `the orderedness of energy quanta, of radium decay, etc.' (Jung 1952:
  517). These are properties of the world which appear to have no deeper cause but are
  `Just-So', i.e., acausal (Jung 1952: 516). In the light especially of this last factor,
  Jung was forced to consider `whether our definition of synchronicity with reference to the
  equivalvence of psychic and physical processes is capable of expansion, or rather,
  requires expansion' (Jung 1952: 516). He concluded that the definition was indeed too
  narrow and needed to be supplemented with the broader category of `general acausal
  orderedness':</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">I incline in fact to the view that synchronicity in the narrow sense is only a
      particular instance of general acausal orderedness -- that, namely, of the equivalence of
      psychic and physical processes where the observer is in the fortunate position of being
      able to recognize the <u>tertium comparationis</u> [i.e., the meaning by which the psychic
      and physical processes are related]. (Jung 1952: 516)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">More specifically, synchronicity in the narrow sense is distinguished from general
  acausal orderedness in that phenomena belonging to the latter category `have existed from
  eternity and occur regularly, whereas the forms of psychic orderedness [i.e.,
  synchronicities] are <u>acts of creation in time</u>' (Jung 1952: 517). He then adds:
  `That, incidentally, is precisely why I have stressed the element of time as being
  characteristic of these phenomena and called them <u>synchronistic</u>' (Jung 1952: 517).
  This represents a significant shift of emphasis -- if not a different view altogether, and
  possibly a more coherent view -- from his earlier explanation in terms of simultaneity
  (Jung 1952: 441).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung's statements about general acausal orderedness are few but have attracted
  interest. For example, Jung several times expresses the view that natural numbers may
  prove particularly important for an understanding of synchronicity: `I feel that the root
  of the enigma', he writes, `is to be found in the properties of whole numbers' (Jung 1976:
  289; see also Jung 1976: 352, 400). This hint has been taken up by von Franz in a number
  of publications (Franz 1974, 1980, 1992).</p>
<b>
</b>
<u>
  <p align="justify"><a name="EpistemologicalStatus">E</a>pistemological status of the principle of
  synchronicity</u></p>
  <p align="justify">`Synchronicity', Jung insists, `is not a philosophical view but an empirical concept
  which postulates an intellectually necessary principle' (Jung 1952: 512); `It is based not
  on philosophical assumptions but on empirical experience and experimentation' (Jung 1951b:
  531); from the material before him he claims that he `can derive no other hypothesis that
  would adequately explain the facts (including the ESP experiments)' (Jung 1952: 505).
  Notwithstanding this last statement, it is `only a makeshift model' and `does not rule out
  the possibility of other hypotheses' (Jung 1976: 437).</p>
  <p align="justify">Other writers, however, have found aspects of the theory of synchronicity to be less
  free from metaphysical presupposition than these statements imply. Explicitly or
  implicitly, Jung's claims to an empirical status for his work are invariably based on an
  appeal to Kant's epistemological distinction between phenomena (things as they appear to
  human consciousness) and noumena (things as they are in themselves) -- Jung's professed
  concern being soley with phenomena (see, e.g., Voogd 1984). However, Wolfgang Giegerich
  has argued that many of the core concepts of Jung's psychology, including the concept of
  synchronicity, overstep the limits prescribed by Kantian epistemology: `As long as Jung
  clings to his label &quot;empiricist first and last,&quot; Kant would show him that he has
  no right to posit, for example, a psychoid archetypal level in which the subject-object
  dichotomy would be overcome' (Giegerich 1987: 111).</p>
  <p align="justify">This issue, as Giegerich implies, goes to the heart of Jung's psychology as a whole.
  Jung himself does appear to have been aware that his thinking on at least synchronicity
  sometimes shifts into metaphysics. In a letter to Fordham (3 January 1957) he
  congratulates Fordham on his essay `Reflections on the Archetypes and Synchronicity'
  (Fordham 1957) and remarks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">I well understand that you prefer to emphasize the archetypal implication in
      synchronicity. This aspect is certainly most important from the psychological angle, but I
      must say that I am equally interested, at times even more so, in the metaphysical aspect
      of the phenomena, and in the question: how does it come that even inanimate objects are
      capable of behaving as if they were acquainted with my thoughts? (Jung 1976: 344)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Again, in a letter to K. Schmid (11 June 1958) Jung first asserts his empiricist
  position by stating that synchronicity `is not a name that characterizes an
  &quot;organizing principle&quot;' but `characterizes a modality' and therefore `is not
  meant as anything substantive' (Jung 1976: 448). However, he then admits that it can
  sometimes be legitimate to conceptualize beyond the bounds of what is empirically knowable
  so long as this conceptualization does not come `from my biased speculation but rather
  from the unfathomable law of nature herself ... from the total man, i.e., from the
  co-participation of the unconscious [in the form of dreams etc.]' (Jung 1976: 448). `This
  far-reaching speculation', he believes, `is a psychic need which is part of our mental
  hygiene', adding, however, that `in the realm of scientific verification it must be
  counted sheer mythology' (Jung 1976: 449). Thus, he is able to excuse some of his own more
  incautious statements regarding synchronicity: `if', he concedes, `I occasionally speak of
  an &quot;organizer,&quot; this is sheer mythology since at present I have no means of
  going beyond the bare fact that synchronistic phenomena are &quot;just so&quot;' (Jung
  1976: 449). Again, after quoting a paragraph from his 1952 essay affirming the
  transcendental nature of the `&quot;absolute knowledge&quot; which is characteristic of
  synchronistic phenomena' (Jung 1952: 506), he admits that `This statement, too, is
  mythology, like all transcendental postulates' (Jung 1976: 449).</p>
<b>
</b>
  <p align="justify"><b><a name="AppliedSynchronicity">FTER</a> SYNCHRONICITY</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Once formulated, the theory of synchronicity provided Jung with insights into a variety
  of subjects and areas of experience -- some of them, not surprisingly, the very ones which
  had challenged him to develop the theory in the first place.</p>
  <p align="justify">At the most fundamental level, synchronicity led Jung to speculate about the nature of
  reality. The fact, for instance, that in synchronistic events the same archetypal pattern
  of meaning seems capable of expressing itself independently in both psychic and physical
  contexts suggested to him that `all reality [may be] grounded on an as yet unknown
  substrate possessing material and at the same time psychic qualities' (Jung 1958b: 411).
  The synchronistic principle `suggests that there is an inter-connection or unity of
  causally unrelated events, and thus postulates a unitary aspect of being which can very
  well be described as the <u>unus mundus</u>' (Jung 1954--55: 464--5). This postulated
  unitary background to existence, in which the concepts of psyche and matter and space and
  time merge into a psychophysical space-time continuum, was where Jung considered the
  archetypes themselves, as opposed to their phenomenal manifestations, ultimately to be
  located. To express this ambivalent nature -- at once psychic and physical yet neither
  because beyond both -- he was led to coin the term `psychoid'. The ability of the
  archetype to manifest synchronistically in independent psychic and physical contexts is
  itself an indicator of its fundamentally psychoid nature.</p>
  <p align="justify">Regarding the phenomenal world rather than its hypothetical substrate, synchronicity,
  as a connecting principle complementary to causality, directs attention to a whole
  dimension of experienceable relationships between events which would be disregarded or
  marginalized by any exclusively causalistic view. On a general level, this helps create
  conceptual space for the acknowledgment of radically anomalous or paranormal events which
  might otherwise be denied.</p>
  <p align="justify">More specifically, in the field of psychical research, the concept of acausal
  connection offers a fresh way of looking at the kind of phenomena usually designated as
  telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, precognition, and so on. Each of these terms, Jung
  felt, perpetuates the expectation of finding some kind of energic and hence causal
  relationship between the events involved, whereas the concept of synchronicity focuses
  attention on the main relationship actually present in experience, namely, the meaningful
  coincidence of the events (Jung 1955--56: 464; Jung 1976: 538). This implies a shift of
  emphasis away from seeking to discover some mechanism or means of transmission at work in
  the events and towards a potentially more illuminating exploration of their psychological
  background and meaning.</p>
  <p align="justify">Even easier to overlook from the causal perspective are the kinds of meaningful acausal
  connections which constitute the correspondences upon which divinatory and similar forms
  of esoteric thinking are based. As Jung's astrological experiment demonstrated, these
  connections, unlike the more radical anomalies, often do not even achieve the salience of
  statistical significance, and so would in many cases not be noticed at all if one were not
  sensitized to their possibility by one's awareness of the principle of synchronicity.</p>
  <p align="justify">There are also many important implications for the practice of psychotherapy. For
  example, Jung recognized that states of mind, such as bad conscience, can sometimes
  express themselves synchronistically in the thoughts and feelings of another person (Jung
  1963: 60--1; Jung 1958d: 450--1) or even through the arrangement of events in the
  environment (Jung 1963: 123--4). In this light, it is not surprising that the occurrence
  of synchronicities can play various kinds of role in the transference/countertransference
  relationship -- sometimes providing crucial insight to either the analyst or the patient
  (Gordon 1983: 138--44), at other times marking a critical or even fatal moment within the
  relationship (Jung 1963: 136--7). Again, Jung points out the possibility, on the part of
  certain patients, of interpreting genuine synchronistic events as delusions (i.e., the
  delusion of believing that quite ordinary events have special reference to them).
  Therapists capable of understanding synchronicity `not as a psychotic but as a normal
  phenomenon' will be able to avoid the therapeutically negative consequences of the
  patients' -- and, if they are not sensitive to synchronicity, their own -- `morbidly
  narrow' interpretation (Jung 1976: 409--10).</p>
  <p align="justify">Spiritual experience is another area to which Jung's theory of synchronicity has been
  applied, both by himself directly and by others elaborating on implications of the theory.
  Thus, the crucial role of synchronicity within Jung's overall psychology of religion has
  been clearly demonstrated by Aziz (1990). In particular, Aziz argues that synchronistic
  experiences enable one to view Jung's core religious process -- individuation -- not just
  intrapsychically but as involving the world beyond the psyche. Synchronicity therefore
  provides the key to freeing Jung from the criticism of psychological reductionism often
  levelled at him by theologians (Aziz 1990: 179--84).</p>
  <p align="justify">On the personal level, Jung's own visionary experiences of union, which attended his
  near-fatal illness in 1944, can also be understood in the light of synchronicity. Although
  he does not himself directly apply the concept of synchronicity to these experiences, his
  characterization of them in terms of `a quality of absolute objectivity' and of `a
  non-temporal state in which present, past, and future are one' (Jung 1963: 275) clearly
  reflects the `absolute knowledge' and `space-time relativity' involved in synchronicities.
  In fact, his sense of his visions as representing a kind of mystic marriage between self
  and world (the <u>hierosgamos</u> or <u>mysterium coniunctionis</u>: Jung 1963: 274--5)
  suggests that they may actually constitute an experiential realization of the unitary
  dimension of existence (the <u>unus mundus</u>) towards which he considered the more
  familiar forms of synchronicity to be pointing.</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung is more explicit concerning the implications of synchronicity for the question of
  possible life after death. For epistemological reasons, he does not think one can actually
  prove that there is survival of death, but he considers it significant that the
  unconscious psyches of people approaching death generally present dreams and other
  spontaneous imagery which imply an expected continuity (Jung 1934: 410--11; Jung 1963:
  278--80). The hint provided by this is supported by two different aspects of
  synchronicity. On a general level, he argues that the space-time relativization involved
  in synchronicity implies that the psyche `exists in a continuum outside time and space'
  (Jung 1976: 561; see also Jung 1934: 412--15; Jung 1963: 282--3). Although we do not know
  in detail what `existence outside time' is like, we can at least infer that it is `outside
  change' and `possesses relative eternity' (Jung 1976: 561) -- grounds for supposing that
  it may not end with the death of the body. More concretely, he considers that certain
  synchronistic phenomena that occur in relation to death -- veridical dreams and
  apparitions, for instance -- can express the idea of survival also in terms of their
  content (Jung 1963: 289--92).</p>
  <p align="justify">Jung sometimes refers to synchronistic events as miracles, though it is clear that he
  does so only in a loose way and certainly without any expectation of having to provide
  theological backing for his usage (e.g., Jung 1976: 537, 540). Occasionally, however, he
  does address the issue of traditionally designated religious miracles and on these
  occasions sometimes refers to synchronicity. Thus, speaking of the identity of Christ the
  `empirical man' with `the traditional Son of Man type', he says: `Wherever such identities
  occur, characteristic archetypal effects appear, that is <u>numinosity</u> and <u>synchronistic
  phenomena</u>, hence tales of miracles are inseparable from the Christ figure' (Jung 1976:
  21). At other times he suggests that explanations for apparent miracles, such as the case
  of Brother Klaus living twenty years without material sustenance, should be sought more
  specifically in the realm of parapsychology and mediumistic phenomena (Jung 1950/1951:
  660). Even here, however, the implication is that the sustained paranormal phenomena
  constituting the miracle are synchronistic archetypal `effects' rendered possible by the
  maintaining of a numinous religious attitude (cf. Jung 1976: 576).</p>
  <p align="justify">Finally, Jung also had recourse to the concept of synchronicity when attempting to
  account for the baffling reports of UFOs. He had kept a close eye on this phenomenon since
  its emergence in the mid 1940s and recognized that it seemed to have both a physical
  aspect (the fact that UFOs are not only seen but are sometimes simultaneously picked up on
  radar) and a psychic aspect (the fact that they `provoked, like nothing else, conscious
  and unconscious fantasies' [Jung 1958b: 313]). He was unable to decide, however, which was
  primary -- whether there were indeed physical events followed by the fantasies, or whether
  the fantasies and visions were arising independently from an activated archetype (Jung
  1958b: 313). In this perplexity he invokes synchronicity as a third possibility,
  suggesting that there may indeed be an anomalous physical phenomenon involved but that
  this meaningfully coincides with, rather than causes, the accompanying fantasizing or
  myth-making, which does indeed have its own independent reasons for surfacing at this time
  (Jung 1958b: 313, 416--17).</p>
  <p align="justify">These examples should suffice to indicate how Jung's theory of synchronicity can
  provide, if not conclusive explanations, at least some stimulating new perspectives on a
  wide range of anomalous phenomena. The theory of synchronicity brings more fully into
  awareness the experiential reality, the complexity, and above all the potential
  meaningfulness of paranormal events. In doing so, it perhaps furthers what Jung once
  described as the `uncomprehended purpose' of `any nocturnal, numinous experience': `to
  make us feel the overpowering presence of a mystery ... shaking our certitudes and lending
  wings to the imagination' (Jung 1958c: 328--9).</p>
