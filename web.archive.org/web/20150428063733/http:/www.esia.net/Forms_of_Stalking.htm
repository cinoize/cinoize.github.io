	<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Almost all stalkers have some
    type of mental or emotional problem. &nbsp; Stalkers will go across town, country, or even
    to different continents in order to continue their stalking.&nbsp; Stable people simply do
    not continue, often in the face of years of rejection, to pursue someone.</font></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial">Stalkers, no matter what or how severe
    their mental disorder, can usually be sorted into one of three major groupings: Simple
    Obsession, Love Obsession, and Other.</font></p>

    Simple Obsession Stalkers</font> </b></p>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>These stalkers have previously been involved in an intimate
      relationship with their victims. Often the victim has attempted to call off the
      relationship but the stalker simply refuses to accept it. These stalkers suffer from
      personality disorders, including being emotionally immature, extremely jealous, insecure,
      have low self-esteem and quite often feel powerless without the relationship. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>While reconciliation is the goal, this stalker believes
      they must have a specific person back or they will not survive. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>The stalker of former spouses or intimate partners, are
      often domineering and abusive to their partners during the relationship and use this
      domination as a way to bolster their own low self esteem. The control the abusers exert
      over their partners gives them a feeling of power they can't find elsewhere. They try to
      control every aspect of their partner's lives. Their worst fear is losing people over whom
      they have control. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>When they realize this fear as the relationship finally
      does end, the stalker suddenly believes that his/her life is destroyed. Their total
      identity and feelings of self-worth are tied up in the power experienced through their
      domineering and abusive relationship. Without this control, they feel that they will have
      no self-worth and no identity. They will become nobodies and in desperation they begin
      stalking, trying to regain their partner and the basis of their power. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>It is this total dependence on their partner for identity
      and feelings of self worth that makes these stalkers so very dangerous. They will often go
      to any length and stop at nothing to get their partner back. If they can't have the people
      over whom they can exert dominance and total control, their lives are truly not worth
      living. Unfortunately, along with becoming suicidal, they also often want to kill the
      intimate partner who have left them. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>Stalking does not always begin with violence or trying to
      terrorize, it usually starts with, &quot;Can I just talk to you or meet with you one last
      time?&quot; &quot; If you just talk to me I'll leave you alone.&quot; According to
      experts, &quot;He wants her back, and she won't come back.&quot; Everything escalates from
      there and sometimes he snaps and assaults or kills her. In his mind, he makes the
      decision, &quot;If I can't have you, no one else will.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he says
      this, he is attempting to cover his fear that she'll meet another man and leave him.&nbsp;
      Far too often, the police find that these stalkers follow through on their threats,
      killing the victims and then many times committing suicide.&nbsp; For them, death is
      better than having to face humiliation of the stalking victim leaving them for someone
      else, and the humiliation of having to face their own powerlessness. </font></p>

    Obsession Stalkers </b></font></p>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>These are individuals who become obsessed with or fixed on
      a person with whom they have had no intimate or close relationship. The victim may be a
      friend, a business acquaintance, a person met only once, or even a complete stranger. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>Love obsession stalkers believe that a special, often
      mystical, relationship exists between them and their victims.&nbsp; Any contact with the
      victim becomes a positive reinforcement of this relationship and any wavering (even the
      slightest) of the victim from an absolute &quot;NO&quot; is seen as an invitation to
      continue the pursuit. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>These stalkers will often read sexual meanings into neutral
      responses from the victim.&nbsp; They are often loners with an emotional void in their
      lives.&nbsp; Any contact with the object of the infatuation, even negative, helps fill
      this void.&nbsp; Failed relationships are the rule among these individuals. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>Many suffer from erotomania.&nbsp; They have the delusion
      that they are loved intensely by another person, usually a person of higher socioeconomic
      status than them or an unattainable public figure.&nbsp; They are totally convinced that
      the stalking victim loves them dearly and truly, and would return their affection except
      for some external influence. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>During questioning, police find that most love obsession
      stalkers have fantasized a complete relationship with the person they are stalking.&nbsp;
      When they attempt to act out this fantasy in real life, they expect the victim to return
      the affection.&nbsp; When no affection is returned, the stalker often reacts with threats
      and intimidation.&nbsp; When the threats and intimidation don't accomplish what they
      hoped, the stalker can often become violent and even deadly. </font></p>

    <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
      <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>Some stalkers harass their victim not out of love but out
      of hate. Occasionally, stalking becomes a method of revenge for some misdeed against the
      stalker, real or imagined.&nbsp; Stalking can also be used as a means of protest.&nbsp;
      This is the smallest group, but this type of stalking, for revenge and protest, can be
      especially dangerous.&nbsp; There have been several killings by stalkers at abortion
      clinics, and mass murders around the country by employees who have been fired and then
      returned to stalk and eventually kill those who have fired them. </font></p>

        <font size="2" face="Arial"><p>Once the relationship ends, this group of stalkers, fearing
        they will lose their identity and self-worth, often become desperate to re-establish the
        dominance and control they wielded during the relationship.&nbsp; If they find this isn't
        possible they can become suicidal, homicidal or both.&nbsp; According to the Bureau of
        Justice Statistics report Female Victims of Violent Crime, in 29 % of all violence against
        women by a lone offender the perpetrator was an intimate.&nbsp; Women are about seven
        times more likely than men to experience violence committed by an intimate, and female
        victims of violence by an intimate are more often injured seriously enough to require
        medical attention than are females victimized by a stranger.&nbsp; Intimate partner
        stalking can end in much worse than just injury.&nbsp; It can end in death if the stalkers
        cannot regain the control they so intensely and desperately need. </font></p>

        our sense of self-worth bruised, perhaps, but still operational. &nbsp; This isn't so,

        most dangerous types of stalker because they often have a history of violence against
        their victim, and consequently feel totally uninhibited about using more or heightened
        violence in an effort to get them back.&nbsp; The stalkers know that violence has worked
        for them in the past, and so they have no reason to believe that it won't work
        again.&nbsp; Also, intimate partner stalkers know their victim well: their family, their
        place of employment, their recreational activities, and so forth.&nbsp; They know where to
        find their victim. </font></p>

        control once held over their victim, often have the mind set that the victim is their
        property, to do with as they wish, and to reclaim in any way they see fit.&nbsp; And,
        believing that their lives won't be worth living if they can't recapture the victim as
        their property, they often feel they have nothing to lose by using extreme measures.&nbsp;
        Consequently, these stalkers feel totally justified in doing just about anything in an
        effort to regain control over the victim.&nbsp; Since the stalker believes the victim
        belongs to them, they show no regard for restraining orders, and may instead be infuriated
        by them, feeling they are being denied their God-given rights. </font></p>

      falsely believes that the nightmare is over, and consequently lets down his/her

        years to move from one phase to another, and some may never move out of the first
