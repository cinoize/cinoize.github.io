</font><font size="3">Our article <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>, "Concerning the Choices 
of Dates for WRR's Rabbis Samples" (Part A), scrutinizes McKay <i>et 
al</i>'s claim that WRR directly optimized the results, by exploiting 
"beneficial" choices pertaining to the dates. Careful examination 
of all the choices indicates the opposite: It shows WRR's perfect integrity. 
Alternative choices, based on McKay <i>et al</i>'s suggestions, would 
have yielded <b>better results </b>&#150;&#150; sometimes by a factor 
of 2 or 3, sometimes by a factor of 10 or 100, and sometimes by a factor 
of <b>tens of thousands</b>. All this starkly contradicts both McKay <i>et 
al</i>'s report and the impression created by their article. These results, 
which constitute <i>direct</i> evidence for WRR's integrity, are far more 
impressive and significant than the <i>indirect</i> evidence sought for 
by McKay <i>et al</i>, in order to prove that WRR "cooked" their 
results. <br>

<br>

How did McKay's reply treat this solid evidence and its conclusions? 
<br>

The answer would surprise only people who are still unfamiliar with 
McKay's previous replies. It transpires that his reply <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note2">[2]</a>, "The 
Choice of Date Forms &#150; a reply to Doron Witztum," <b>is actually 
no reply at all. </b>Instead, it's a failed attempt to lay a smokescreen, 
specifically by constructing new "straw men". <br>

<br>

</font><font size="5"><a name="how">How does McKay's reply tackle the direct evidence 
which indicates that WRR acted honestly?</a><br>

</font><font size="3">In the introduction to our article <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> we wrote: 

<blockquote>
In this section we will scrutinize MBBK's claim that WRR directly optimized 
the results by exploiting "beneficial" choices pertaining to 
the dates. <br>

Concerning direct optimization, remember that originally P1 and P2 were 
the sole statistics used to measure the success of L1 and L2. Therefore, 
any optimization of dates must have been in relation to P1 or P2, or, 
more probably, in relation to Min(P1-P2). Therefore, it is most sensible 
to examine the situation with these statistics. </blockquote>

Accordingly, we brought the results of many experiments which show that 
WRR acted honestly in the choices indicated by McKay <i>et al</i>.<br>

<br>

McKay's reply tries to evade this evidence in two ways: <br>
<br>
1.   It tries to cancel the significance of our results with the following 
"maneuver": Claiming false assertions, it attempts to negate 
the legitimacy of using measures P1 and min(P1,P2). (This is done in the 
section named "The choice of success measure"). <br>

2.  It draws one's attention from the meaning of our results &#150;
that WRR acted honestly &#150; to a totally different subject (in the 
section titled "Variations that add data"). <br>

<br>
Let us deal briefly with these two points. <br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKay claims that 
the use of P1 and min(P1,P2) was invented only <b>after </b>the publicizing 
of our original experiments on the rabbis lists; thus he wishes to destroy 
the legitimacy of our using these criteria in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>.<br>

<br>

<u>Our reply:  <br>

</u>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our first preprint 
<a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3]</a> we defined the following measure, which we will denote here as P'1. 
Out of the <i>n</i> results (for "name&#150;date" pairs) of 
the whole sample, we counted the number of results whose values were smaller 
or equal to p=0.2. We denoted this number by <i>S</i>. The probability 
of getting such a big <i>S</i> can be calculated directly (under certain 
assumptions) using the binomial distribution. Because this calculation 
is quite complicated, we did it through the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution: We counted how many standard deviations there were 
between <i>S</i> and the expected value. This number is P'1. In a table, 
we denoted the value of P'1 together with the values of <i>n, p </i>and 
<i>S, </i>so that the reader could calculate the odds of <i>S</i> being 
so great: Either by translating the value of P'1 into probabilities, or 
by a direct calculation using the binomial distribution.<br>

<u><br>

For example</u>: For the first sample we gave the following data: <br>

Total number of pairs:  <i>n</i>=152. <br>

Number of results whose value was less than or equal to  <i>p</i>=0.2: 
 <i>S=</i>63.<br>

Number of results whose value was less than or equal to <i>p</i>=0.2, 
which would be randomly expected:  <i>E=np=</i>30.4. <br>

The standard  deviation: <font size="2">SIGMA = SQRT</font>[<i>np</i>(1-<i>p</i>)]=4.93. 
<br>

Number of standard deviations: P'1=(<i>S-E</i>)/ <font size="2">SIGMA</font> = 6.61. 
<br>

Translating the value of P'1 into probability gives: 1.92x10<sup>-11</sup>.<br>

<br>

On the other hand, a direct calculation of the probability, using the 
binomial distribution gives the value of P1. In our example: P1=1.33x10<sup>-9</sup>. 
This is the accurate value. <br>

After our two experiments were published in our second preprint <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note4">[4]</a>, 
a software which directly computes P1 was prepared for us, and we no longer 
needed to use the approximation P'1.<br>

<br>

McKay's claim is that in the computations involved in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>, I should 
have used P'1 rather than P1.<br>

<br>

But it should be noticed, that when P1 gets smaller &#150; so does P'1, 
and vice versa: when P1 get bigger &#150; so does P'1. <b>Therefore, whenever 
the choices pertaining to dates lead to an improvement of P1 &#150; P'1 
will also be improved, and vice versa</b>. <br>
<table width="100%" border="1" align="CENTER">
<tr><td>
Moreover, new computations reveal that the conclusions arrived at in 
<a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> <b>remain valid</b> even when P1 and min(P1,P2) are replaced by P'1 
and min(P'1,P2), respectively.</td></tr></table><br>

<b>Thus, using this claim, McKay failed to invalidate the conclusions 
of <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>.</b> On the other hand, McKay's claim destroys one of the central 
assertions of &#133;McKay <i>et al</i>, an assertion which relies entirely 
upon replacing P'1 with P1. Namely, McKay <i>et al</i> used P1 in their 
computations instead of P'1. If we correct this mistake (according to 
McKay's present claim), their whole assertion will collapse! (See in the 
Appendix, <a href="dat2_hb.htm#A">A</a>).<br>

<br>

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning min(P1,P2):<br>

McKay himself writes that we considered the two measures, P1 and P2, 
as probabilities. So, obviously, if we give two results, we would expect 
the reader to be impressed by the better one: This is the mathematical 
logic of presenting two results.<br>

Perhaps McKay doesn't understand this simple rationale? Don't worry 
&#150; he does! Elsewhere, he even uses it himself to support certain 
of his own claims (see in the Appendix, <a href="dat2_hb.htm#B">B</a>).<br>

<br>

<u>Conclusion</u>: McKay's assertions fail to save him from the clear 
conclusions of <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>.<br>

<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the section headed 
"Variations that add data," McKay's reply tries to distract 
attention from the true meaning of our results in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>: That WRR acted 
honestly. McKay writes: 
<blockquote>
 "Witztum presents a number of examples where adding additional 
data to his experiment (such as additional date forms) improves the value 
of P1 and P2. This can occasionally be justified in a study of choice 
making, though not always. Leaving that issue aside, we wish to record 
here why such experiments are irrelevant to the issue of whether the codes 
are genuine."</blockquote>

McKay then proceeds to present the results of an experiment, which shows 
that P1 and P2 do not represent statistical significance. <br>

<br>

<u>Our reply: </u><br>

We do not claim that P1 and P2 represent the statistical significance. 
P1 and P2 are the overall measures, used as a measure of success in the 
original experiment. To calculate the statistical significance of P1 and 
P2, a permutation test was devised and conducted more than two years later. 
All this is explained in our paper in <i>Statistical Science </i><a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3]</a>.<br>

Our article <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> also never claims that the improvements in the results 
of P1 and P2, or of min(P1,P2), indicate improvement of the significance 
of the overall result. <br>

<br>

<b>So what did we prove in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>? <br>

</b>In <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> we examined and proved that WRR's choice of data was perfectly 
honest. (It's worthwhile to see the many results there that prove this). 
There was no optimization. This is true even where, according to McKay 
<i>el al</i>, this could have easily been done. <br>

We did this by examining the various changes produced in the values 
of P1 and P2 (which were the yardsticks of the original experiment's success) 
by the various alternative choices. Time after time, it was demonstrated 
that WRR <b>did nothing </b>to choose the more "beneficial" 
possibilities. <br>

<br>

It should be noted that WRR's experiment included two components:<br>

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation of the 
data.<br>

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct statistical 
measurement of the significance.<br>

The results of the experiment depend on the correct performance of these 
two components.  <br>

Concerning component <i>b</i>, it is clear that the significance must 
be measured with the randomization test, as publicized in our article 
in <i>Statistical Science </i><a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3]</a>.  <br>

Concerning component <i>a</i>, the crucial question is whether the 
data was prepared honestly. Indeed, the evidence brought in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">
[1]</a> is intended
solely to demonstrate this point. It's obvious that the examination of 
component <i>a</i> must be conducted using the same measures of success 
that existed when the data was prepared.<br>

Since we proved in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> that component <i>a</i> was done honestly, we 
thus proved that WRR's result is correct. This proved that the Genesis 
Code is genuine.  <br>

<br>

Nevertheless, McKay's reply tries to create the misleading impression 
that we treated P1 and P2 as statistical significance in <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>, and that 
our conclusions there are based on this error. This is nothing but an 
attempted smokescreen. <br>

<br>

</font><font size="5"><a name="mckay">McKay's "straw man" concerning the date forms</a><br>

</font><font size="3">The overwhelming evidence in our article <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> that 
the date forms were chosen with honesty and integrity, obviously embarrassed 
McKay. We show there, that the natural extension of the list of date forms 
improves the results according to the original criteria of success. We 
also show that there is an improvement even if we include the pair of 
date forms "א' לתשרי"  and "בא' לתשרי"  
(which McKay <i>et al</i> had suggested, even though they are not included 
in a natural extension). For the reader's convenience, we quote in Appendix 
<a href="dat2_hb.htm#choice6">(C)</a> the relevant material from <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a> (Sec. 6 of its Appendix).<br>

<br>

McKay's reply ignores all this. Instead, he tries to deflect the discussion 
to some marginal issue. But since, even there, he has little to say, he 
also sets up an appropriate straw man, as we will see later.  <br>

<br>

The marginal issue discussed this time, is how to present the frequency 
of several date forms in Table 16 of <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>. <br>

<br>

<u>What is Table 16?</u><br>

Through table 16 (see Appendix, <a href="dat2_hb.htm#choice6">C</a>) I demonstrated that the forms <br>

a. א' תשרי.<br>

b. בא' תשרי<br>

c. א' בתשרי.<br>

d. בא' בתשרי<br>

are not only standard in <i>Encyclopedia Margaliot (EM) </i>and <i>Encyclopedia</i> 
<i>Hebraica</i> but also standard and widespread in the Hebrew language. 
To this end, I conducted a survey regarding the use of the various date 
forms. The survey was done using a database, which, as far as <b>Hebrew 
</b>is concerned, is similar to these encyclopedias: The database 
of "modern <i>Halachic</i> authorities" (taken from the computerized 
Responsa database of the Bar-Ilan University). The results of this survey 
are listed in Table 16. The prevalence of the variant date forms was presented 
for the pairs of date forms I, II, and III, which were defined as follows. 
<br>

I="א' בתשרי"+"בא' בתשרי",<br>

II="א' בתשרי" +"בא' בתשרי" , <br>

III="א' לתשרי" +"בא' לתשרי",<br>

The results show that the prevalence of III is far smaller than that 
of I or II. <br>

<br>

<u>The straw man's conception: </u><br>

McKay's reply proceeded to set up a straw man: <br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ascribed to me the claim that of the four standard forms <i>a-d</i>, 
forms <i>a-c</i> are the most common.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ascribed to me the claim that the sole criterion for using a 
date is its frequency of use:<blockquote>
"His case is that the common forms should be used and the uncommon forms 
should not be".</blockquote>

In particular, he ascribed to me the position, that the non-use of the 
forms <br>"א' לתשרי" and "בא' לתשרי" 
was based purely on their frequency in the computerized Responsa database 
of the Bar-Ilan University.<br>

<br>

The next stage included the invention of the following fiction: That 
Table 16 is the result of a deliberate deception (what otherwise?) on 
my part. McKay's reply utilizes the "straw man" to show, that the method 
of presenting <b>pairs</b> of dates in the table, and not single dates, 
combined with the fact that I only use the database of "modern <i>Halachic</i> 
authorities" (and not the entire Responsa database) is meant to conceal:<br>

3.  That forms <i>a-c</i> are not the most prevalent, and that I therefore 
acted contrary to the established "criterion" by not using form 
<i>d</i> in the original experiment. <br>

4.   That I acted contrary to my own criterion, when, in the process 
of extending the list of date forms (done in the Appendix of <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1">[1]</a>, section 
6 - see here, section C of the Appendix), I added the pair of forms
"א' דתשרי"  and "בא' דתשרי". <br>

<br>

<u>The "straw man's" death: </u><br>

McKay's straw man is a combination of a selective and truncated quotation, 
followed by misleading interpretation. By dint of simply examining the 
facts &#150; the straw man vaporizes and vanishes. <br>

<br>

In the Appendix <a href="dat2_hb.htm#destroying">(D)</a> I prove that the two claims which McKay ascribes 
to me (1 and 2 above) are figments of the imagination; therefore "
facts" 3 and 4 <b>are false</b>. Consequently, McKay's conclusions 
are baseless. <br>

Consequently, there is no basis for the conclusions towards which McKay 
tries to drive the reader. <br>

<br>

Let us once more remind the reader, that the whole issue of Table 16 
is of marginal importance; it is merely meant to demonstrate that the 
prevalence of III is tiny compared to that of I and II, and nothing more. 
In fact, the data presented by McKay shows <b>the same thing. </b><br>

<br>

<u>Pairs of date forms: </u><br>

The most surprising aspect of this protracted tale is that McKay knows 
perfectly well that there is no "mystery" in the fact that Table 
16 was presented through <b>pairs </b>of date forms. According to <b>his</b> 
logic &#150; this should be the <b>natural course. </b><br>

It is McKay <i>et al</i> who wrote <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note6">[6]</a> that the adding of date form 
<i>d</i> would be the most natural: 
<blockquote>
"The most obvious variation would have been to add the form akin 
to 'on 1st of May'." (Pg. 168-169)</blockquote>

Why do they consider this variation the most obvious? <br>

Let us explain: <br>

<ul>

<li>According to them, from among the four forms <i>a-d</i>, only <b>two 
</b>basic forms exist:<br>
Form <i>a</i> ("א' תשרי") and form <i>c</i> ("א' בתשרי").<br>
Forms <i>b</i> ("בא' תשרי") and <i>d</i> ("בא' בתשרי") 
result from adding the letter "ב" to forms <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> (respectively).
<br>
The letter "ב" (which serves as the word <i>in
</i>or<i> on</i>) serves merely as preposition to link the date to other 
words in the text. [For example: The preposition "on" in the 
phrase "on the 27<sup>th</sup> of April" is not part of the date].<br>

Therefore, <b>according to McKay <i>et al</i>, </b>the forms <i>a-b</i> 
are essentially one date form, and the forms <i>c-d</i> are also essentially 
one date form. This is why they think that variation <i>d</i> should be 
added to variations <i>a-c</i>. 

<li>When they suggest additional date forms, "א' של תשרי" and "א' לתשרי
", they do this in <b>pairs</b>:<br>
* "א של תשרי"  and  "א לתשרי" *, * "בא של תשרי" and "בא לתשרי" *<br>
Each pair essentially represents <i>one</i> date form.<br>

</ul>

Therefore, specifically according to the logic of McKay <i>et al</i>, 
if the relative prevalence of date forms in a certain pool is sought for, 
it should be done in pairs &#150; as we indeed did. <br>

So why does McKay pretend to be unable to fathom the reason we did this? 
<br>

<br>

</font><font size="5"><a name="observation">An observation</a><br>

</font><font size="3">In the section titled "One final observation"
 McKay describes his observation: He noticed that while the success of 
WRR's first list hinged mainly on the date form <br>
"בא' תשרי", the success of the second list hinged mainly on the form "א' תשרי". 
McKay regards this as a contradiction and a disproof of the Torah Codes. 
<br>

<br>

But, this is nonsense.<br>

First, McKay forgot that WRR's work was aimed at proving <i>the existence 
</i>of a hidden text in Genesis. Having such a proof at hand does not 
necessarily enable one to decode the language of the hidden text: One 
must first recognize the syntax and know far more about the vocabulary 
of the hidden text. (The parable in the introduction to our <i>Statistical 
Science </i>paper <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3]</a> may help to explain this point.) <br>

Thus, McKay's claim concerning the "contradiction" is mere 
speculation concerning the unknown syntax of the hidden text. <br>

<br>

The surprising point is that McKay forgot another observation which 
he had made. <br>

In the previous section, "Pairs of date forms," we mentioned 
that according to the logic of McKay <i>et al</i>, the two date forms, 
<br>
a. "א' תשרי"<br>

b. "בא' תשרי"
<br>
are actually one basic date form. Form <i>b</i> is created from <i>a</i> 
by adding the preposition  "ב", which merely links the date to other 
words in the hidden text. <br>

<br>

If we combine both of McKay's observations, it turns out that the <i>same</i> 
basic date form succeeded in both lists!<br>

<br>

<br>

<center></font><font size="5"><a name="appendix">Appendix</a><br>

</font><font size="3"><br>

</center><a name="A">A.</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will 
be shown here, that one of McKay <i>et al's </i>main assertions rests 
entirely upon the replacement of P'1 by P1: McKay <i>et al</i> used P1 
in their computations instead of P'1. If we correct this mistake (according 
to McKay), and replace P1 by P'1 - their whole assertion will collapse! 
<br>

McKay wrote a paper together with Kalai and Bar-Hillel <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note7">[7]</a>, which developed 
the following story:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They noticed that the value of the measure P2 for the <i>first</i> 
list of Rabbis (L1) was very close to its value for the <i>second</i> 
list of Rabbis (L2), with a ratio of 1.12. The <i>a posteriori</i> probability 
for such event is (according to them) approximately 0.01.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They assert that WRR had "naive expectations" to get 
"similar success" in their second experiment. Therefore WRR 
"cooked" the data for L2 to get a success most similar to that of L1. <br>

<br>
(See also McKay <i>et al'</i>s <i>Statistical Science </i>paper <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note6">[6]</a>, 
section 8).<br>

<br>

<u>But:<br>

</u>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability 
calculated by McKay <i>et al</i> is <b>meaningless</b>, since the number 
of potential <i>a posteriori</i> observations is so vast: Such exceptional 
<i>a posteriori </i>observations, with similar <i>a posteriori </i>probabilities, 
can be found for <b>every</b> experiment. <br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKay <i>et al'</i>s<i> 
</i>result is erroneous. <br>

Their result is based on the values of P2. Why specifically P2?<br>

They assert in their paper <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note7">[7]</a> (at the beginning of section 3):<br>
<blockquote>
"For our purpose, the P2 value remains pertinent, since any bias 
in the data selection occurred at the time when it served as<b> the principal 
measure of significance". </b>(Emphasis mine)</blockquote>

But this assertion has no basis in WRR's preprints. WRR merely presented 
the values of P'1 and P2, and never presented P2 as "the principal 
measure of significance" (see <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3,4]</a>).<br>

McKay <i>et al</i>'s assertion could only be based mathematically on 
calculating min(P1,P2).
<br>
In fact, <b>for both lists</b> we get: P2=min(P1,P2).<br>

This is the mathematical basis for their assertion that P2 was the "leading"
measure in both experiments.<br>

<br>

But, according to McKay's claim <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note2">[2]</a> that we should consider P'1 and 
not P1, we should<br> calculate min(P'1,p2) and not min(P1,P2).<br>

In such a case we would get <b>for both lists</b>:        P'1=min(P'1,P2).<br>

Therefore, in both experiments, the P'1 value was the "leading"
 one. Hence, if WRR "cooked" the data for L2 to get a success 
closest to that of L1 (as McKay <i>et al </i>claim), they should have 
taken care that the <b>P'1 values</b> be similar. Let's see what really 
happened: <br>

The "leading" value for L1 was P'1=1.92x10<sup>-11<br>

</sup>The "leading" value for L2 was P'1=3.87x10<sup>-10</sup>.<br>

The ratio of these values is 20.16 &#150; which completely opposes McKay 
<i>et al</i>'s naive expectations.<br>

<a name="B">B.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckay well understands, 
that by presenting <i>two</i> results, we expect the reader to be impressed 
by the better one. For example, in the "study of variations"
 described in McKay <i>et al'</i>s paper <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note6">[6]</a>, they checked the measure 
min(r1-r4) for the <i>first</i> list (r1,r2,r3,r4 are the ranks in the 
permutation test), in spite of McKay's present claim that WRR did not 
define a measure of "minimum" for this <i>first</i> list!<br>

<b>6.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of date
forms. </b> <br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the dates pertaining to L1 are given in <i>EM</i> in standard 
forms and not specified by "special days". Of the 37 dates in 
L1, 30 are given in standard forms. <i>EM</i> used four standard forms:<br>

<ol type="a">

<li> "א' תשרי" .<br>

<li> "בא' תשרי"  .<br>

<li> "א' בתשרי"   .<br>

<li> "בא' בתשרי" . 

</ol>

The linguist Ya'akov Orbach, WRR's linguistic advisor, suggested using 
the three standard forms a-c. We do not know his reasons, and we specifically 
do not know whether he examined or considered the forms used by <i>EM</i>. 
(Perhaps it is just a coincidence that the date forms used by Encyclopedia 
Hebraica for the rabbis of L1 are precisely forms a-c.). <br>

<br>

<b>(A)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBBK wrote 
concerning this: <br>
<blockquote>
"To write the day and the month, WRR used three forms, approximately 
corresponding to the English forms "May 1st," "1st of May"
 and "on May 1st". They did not use the obvious "on 1st 
of May," which is frequently used by Margaliot&#133;" (Pg. 155)
</blockquote>
They also wrote: <br>
<blockquote>
"The most obvious variation would have been to add the form akin 
to "on 1st of May". It gives the score [1.2, 2.2;
 0.6, 16.4]." (Pgs. 168-169)</blockquote>

We examined MBBK's "most obvious" choice of including the 
fourth form, d, as well. Let us check the following choices:<br>

<ol>

<li>	Forms a-c (used by WRR).<br>

<li>	Forms a-d. <br>

</ol>

The results are:<br>

<table width="65%" border="1" align="CENTER">

<tr align="CENTER">

<td><u><b>0.3</b></u></td>

</tr>

</table>

<center>Table 14<br>

</center>Note that the result improves contrary to the result given 
by MBBK! (As we proved elsewhere <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3" "><a href="dat2_hb.htm#note3">[3]</a></a>, their method of presenting results 
is designed to conceal results like these).<br>

<br>

<b>(B)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBBK had further 
suggestions to widen the choice of standard forms. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We must emphasize once more that the forms a&#150;d are the most standard 
and widespread in Hebrew, and are used not only by <i>EM</i>, but also 
by Encyclopedia Hebraica and similar works. Any other form is rare compared 
to these and it is extremely doubtful whether it may be regarded as a 
choice. In any case, if MBBK were searching for additional forms, they 
should have been consistent and first looked for them in <i>EM</i> which 
they refer to at every opportunity.<br>

 <br>

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the possibilities of expanding the list of date forms, 
while adhering to <i>EM.</i> For a complete picture we will start with 
the choice already examined in (A): 
<ol>

<li>	Forms a-c.<br>

<li>	Forms a-d.  <br>

</ol>

(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBBK already suggested 
dates specified by "special days" (Sec. 4 above) mentioned in 
<i>EM</i>. For these dates <i>EM</i> used the possessive word
"של" ("shell") and the possessive letter  "ד"  ("de") to express dates. With 
this usage we get the following forms. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. "א' של תשרי"  .<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. "בא' של תשרי"  .<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. "א' דתשרי"  .<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. "בא' דתשרי"  . <br>

(Forms e-f were suggested also by MBBK.) Adding these choices to 
the previous ones brings us to the next choice:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Forms a-h.<br>
<br>
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, MBBK 
suggested two <i>other</i> forms. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. "א' לתשרי"   .<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j. "בא' לתשרי"  . <br>

These two forms are not only absent from <i>EM</i> (and Encyclopedia 
Hebraica), but they are also rarely used (see Table 16). <br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, to complete the picture, we will also examine the following 
choice. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To take all the forms, a-j.<br>

<br>

The results of these choices are:<br>

</center><br>

It turns out that even adding forms i-j yields a result <b>2.5 times 
better</b> than WRR's original!<br>

<br>

<u>Conclusion:</u> The results speak for themselves: Beyond any doubt, 
WRR acted with perfect integrity in their choice of date forms!<br>

<br>

<b>(C)</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning 
the frequency of the forms i-j: <br>

At the beginning of the controversy <a href="dat2_hb.htm#note1" 4">[14]</a> we wrote, concerning their 
suggestion to use form i:<br>
<blockquote>
"This is a nonstandard form of referring 
to a date. For example, both Margalioth's encyclopedia, as well as the 
Encyclopedia Hebraica use the forms we used, and not this form. It is 
clear that the forms we used are the most widely used forms. We conducted 
a survey regarding the use of the various forms, using the computerized 
responsa database of Bar Ilan University. Here are the results for a pool 
of modern Halachic authorities:
We will categorize the forms as follows:<br>

Form I is the pair of forms:
"בא' תשרי"+"א' תשרי" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
("בא' תשרי" = in "א' תשרי")
<br>

Form II is the pair of forms:  "בא' בתשרי"+"א' בתשרי" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
("בא' בתשרי" = in "א' בתשרי")<br>

Form III is the pair of forms: "בא' לתשרי"+"א' לתשרי"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ("בא' לתשרי" = in "א' לתשרי")</blockquote>

<center>Table 16<br>

</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MBBK certainly exaggerated when they described forms III
as "regular date forms". <br>

<br>

<font size="4"><a name="destroying">
D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroying McKay's
straw man concerning Table 16:</a></font><br>

<br>

&gt;From the previous section we see, that contrary to McKay's claims: <br>

<br>

1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never claimed that date form <i>d</i> is less common than forms 
<i>a-c.</i> I just wrote as follows: <br>
<blockquote>
"We must emphasize once more that the forms a&#150;d are the most 
standard and widespread in Hebrew, and are used not only by <i>EM</i>, 
but also by Encyclopedia Hebraica and similar works. Any other form is 
rare compared to these and it is extremely doubtful whether it may be 
regarded as a choice."</blockquote>

Moreover, I certainly didn't explain that forms <i>a-c</i> were chosen 
by the linguist Yaakov Orbach o.b.m. because they were the most prevalent. 
Indeed, I once more explained that <b>I did not know </b>what guided him 
in this choice. (McKay himself quotes this statement, unaware that it 
contradicts the very basis of his straw man.)<br>

<b>Therefore, it was never necessary to prove and demonstrate in Table 
16, that specifically date forms <i>a-c</i> were the most common. <br>

<br>

</b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set up no criteria of the type that McKay tries to ascribe 
to me. The objective of the previous section was to find the natural extension 
of the list of date forms. Concerning this we wrote:<br>
<blockquote>
"Any other form is rare compared to these [<i>a-d</i>] and it is 
extremely doubtful whether it may be regarded as a choice. In any case, 
if MBBK were searching for additional forms, they should have been consistent 
and first looked for them in <i>EM</i> which they refer to at every opportunity.
<br>
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the possibilities 
of expanding the list of date forms, while adhering to <i>EM&#133;</i>"
</blockquote>

And our rationale for the negation of forms "א' לתשרי" and "בא' לתשרי" was as
follows: <br>

"(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, MBBK suggested two <i>other</i> forms. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.  "א' לתשרי".<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j.  "בא' לתשרי". <br>

These two forms are not only absent from <i>EM</i> (and Encyclopedia 
Hebraica), but they are also rarely used (see Table 16)." <br>

<br>

In other words, it was determined here, that all the other forms are 
rare compared to forms <i>a&#150;d</i>, and therefore the natural extension 
of the list of date forms should include those forms which have the advantage 
of being used in the encyclopedia. <br>

<br>

Therefore, contrary to McKay's claims: <br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did <b>not</b> 
act contrary to the "criterion" when form <i>d</i> was not used 
in our original work. <br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did <b>not </b>act 
contrary to my criterion when I indicated that the choice of the forms 
"א' דתשרי" and " בא' דתשרי" (the 
usage of the letter "ד" here is legitimate in Hebrew, 
and is used by the Encyclopedia Hebraica) is preferable to the date forms 
"א' לתשרי" and "בא' לתשרי" (the like of which are not found in the encyclopedia). <br>

<br>

Therefore, the "explanation" McKay "cooked," concerning 
the method used to present date forms in Table 16 &#150; is completely 
baseless. <br>

<br>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKay also asks why 
I used only the database of "modern <i>Halachic</i> authorities",
to demonstrate the frequencies of the pairs of date forms. Here, too, 
the answer is simple. In order to demonstrate "that the forms <i>a&#150;
d</i> are the most standard and widespread in Hebrew," and not only 
in the encyclopedia, I looked for a database similar to the encyclopedia 
in its usage of Hebrew, and found the database of "modern <i>Halachic</i> 
authorities" to be appropriate.<br>

Note that even according to the database checked by McKay, the prevalence 
of III is much less than that of I and II, as we demonstrated in Table 
16. <br>
