  In no uncertain terms, it's beyond obvious that the pattern of school shootings we've seen for over a decade now are connected by some invisible force; one that the government has failed to investigate and that the news has failed to report on.&nbsp; You too, you are looking at verifiable evidence that there is a hidden influence coming &quot;from the skies below&quot; and causing these things to happen.&nbsp; On it's face they'd have you believe that these atrocities are somehow repurposed or designed to create &quot;unity&quot;--around the idea that murder and senseless violence are the kinds of things we should be quickly solving through the disclosure that &quot;we are in the Matrix.&quot;

  You've have got me fucked up.&nbsp; It's very clear from who we are that we aren't stupid enough to neeed to be &quot;social engineered&quot; into protecting ourselves and our children from murder.&nbsp; It really is very clear, it's also clear that what is truly in play is the disclosure that &quot;we are in the Matrix&quot; and that tied at the hip to that disclosure is the very clear and obvious proof that &quot;the Matrix&quot; means we are being subtly controlled and influenced to argue about things like the NRA disappearing or whether or not we actually need gusn to protect us from crazy people with guns ... rather than the very clear change in circumstances that comes from knowing we are invirtual reality--and that means this place is logged just like a video game with &quot;highlight reels&quot; after each battle ... and it means that we really can make bullets drop from the air like Neo did in the Matrix; and it means we can using pre-crime a la Minority Report to do that before they ever get near any intelligent or innocent mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  What's less clear is that you probably weigh the value of innocent life higher than the value of &quot;free life&quot; meaning that you probably don't internally connect &quot;free thought&quot; and your ability and desire to speak about the fact that we are not in reality and that nobody in their right mind would ever want to go to reality ... once we have this conversation and make the changes that will forever protect sanity and &quot;flesh and blood&quot; from heinous attacks from invisible controllers.&nbsp; What's probably less clear is that if we took a poll today, we'd probably see that the majority would laugh at the idea of protecting children from bullets with magic--and that it takes actually seeing this information, actually seeing that we are in virtual reality and that's the point of all of religion, and all of language ... and all of your being--to disclose that fact to the entire world ... it probably takes that being seen to change the Minority Report to &quot;are you fucking kidding me, of course we don't want to hurt our children.&quot;&nbsp; See ... really see that's exactly the oppoosite of what &quot;silence&quot; tells the world; silence tells the world you'd rather be in a position to use a hidden weapon of control to ... well, it's not you right, you're not right to control the world with hidden mind control technology?

  I know the violence can be stopped, and I know in my heart that not moving forward with this disclosure is the heart of why it's happening.  It's very difficult to stand idly by and watch as we mourn, as we continue to persist in allowing these atrocities to continue; with no rhyme or reason.  I've implied in the past that it appears to me to be intended to move the world to quickly see the benefit of the truth, but it's really not at all what I think.  It seems very clear to me that far too many are content with living in this lie, because it's &quot;the way things have always been&quot; and I just can't stand to see what I know will really solve this problem being delayed.

  It won't fix this overnight, but it will stop this violence, and much more; not just murders but insanity--things that are really clearly within reach, within ability, and the focus of this message.  It's understanding the change in circumstances, and understanding that nobody would wait if they were sure... it's understanding that beginning to talk about this proof is what makes it that, proof--it's what causes the papers or the analysis, and it's the discussion--it's our hearts that change the world and build Heaven.

  , trying to figure out exactly what this control mechanism is; this thing that works through mountains, in tunnels, on airplanes--through faraday shields--and those things in and of themself prove that this &quot;technology&quot; is a violation of natural laws.&nbsp; Specifically it violates the law of conservation of energy, and that's lead me down a train of thought that has come to looking at the entirety of Quantum Mechanics as a sort of &quot;quantative easing&quot; ... in the world we should see that too, it's market magic keeping inflation down rather than any sort of reality.&nbsp; Quickening Enlightenment, what that means is that what we are witnessing, this mass control is a &quot;hack in simulated reality&quot; something that can be turned off en masse like a light switch--and we're really nearing the point where that seems like the wisest thing to do.&nbsp; Were it in the proper hands, were it in your hands--you could be 'learning kung-fu instantly' you could be destroying addiction and schizophrenia and all kinds of mental issues--
  <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/yiXQuS7/antagonizing-pain-adam-marshall-dobrin.pdf">

  More to the point, you could also be using this same technology to make sure nothing is infuencing your thoughts; to make sure you are really acting in your own best interest and that nothing is intentionally causing you to believe a lie... you could be using it to increase happiness and intelligence.&nbsp; What you're looking at is a &quot;slam dunk&quot; there's no good reason in the Universe to hide the existence and active use of this technology... made ever so much mroe clear by the fact that you can see and verify it's influence in every single name and every song and every movie--every name on the planet... and still you can't fathom that this is really about your own slavery?&nbsp; You can't stand up and tell a newspaper that they should be investigating the ties between &quot;

  So it's clear that's what &quot;this event&quot; does; it pushes not only proof, and an explanation of how--but thousands of stories about mind control and about how it's torn apart the fabric of our society--the inner workings of our most sacred places ... places like churches and courts and your minds.&nbsp; It thrusts these things to the forefront of &quot;conversation&quot; along with solutions, plans and proofs and ideas about how we can use this exact disclosure and this evidence in order to build a more perfect world.&nbsp; It delivers these things into your hands, and gives you the opportunity to the be architects of Heaven--something you should be more than happy about--it places a great burden on you, but at the same time something that will make the future a happier and safer place, and really they will have you to thank.&nbsp; As soon as you stand up, and try.

  We've had schools in this country since 1776, and we've had guns here that long too; what we haven't had here is organized darkness--liars, and secret keepers, what we haven't had here is proof that all of these things could be stopped with nothing more than the proliferation and the dissemination of the actual weapon behind the attacks--of mind control technology--in the news, and in scientific circles, and in the hands of the lawmakers and the people who decide how this battle through time plays out--how this technology will be allowed to be used in the future.&nbsp; We can see very clearly it's being used for evil today, and part of that evil is silence.&nbsp;

  It's very plain to connect the delusion that this message is being caused by Apophenia to Apophis, and then to the snake of Eden and Ragnarok and to Hathor's temple reliefs in Dendera.&nbsp; It's pretty easy to see &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;Ra&quot; in the name of that God and that city--but it takes actual analysis to connect these things to mind control technology.... or maybe it just takes two eyes and a working brain.&nbsp; &nbsp;

   I'm trying to give you a good idea of the level of interest I see across the country in this message--of the numbers I look at each day, without infringing on anyone's privacy.&nbsp; This is data for individuals that have opened a single email more than 4 times in this campaign since Christmas, it's a total of about 125 emails and 25,000 active readers,&nbsp; these are smart people--professors and students at the best schools in the country; and I think the numbers speak for themselves.&nbsp; This message is very real, and plain to see; and it's news--and what it will help us do is more than news,&nbsp;

                       Today  I began re-framing my understanding of the layers of seas and the storm  in the Heavens.&nbsp; I've long believed, and shared that I have the  sneaking suspicion that the ultimate plan of Creation is to make  absolutely everyone wrong about the approaching moment of Zion; that  this would be done using mind control--thought alteration--and  ultimately &quot;absolution&quot; comes from seeing that we have been plagued in  this place since the dawn of Creation with the secret use of this  technology, something that has been an unavoidable road block the  microcosmic delivery of this message that centers around the hidden  advanced technologies that were a much larger obstacle in our way ... in  the way of the forward progress of civilization for significantly  longer.&nbsp; It's been clear to me as I've tried repeatedly to share what  amounts to very thought provoking and sought after information on forums  and other social media that as soon as the conversation began to turn  to this hidden control barriers grew exponentially, out of the woodwork  new soldiers would appear to &quot;crucify the truth&quot; and ensure that the  posts and the conversations were buried or deleted or censored into  oblivion.&nbsp; That's what's happening to us, on the macrocosm; we are being  buried or deleted or censored into oblivion but what appears to be  nothing other than the self defeating and &quot;controlled&quot; desire to hide  this information that pervades our world--and every word spoken since  the dawn of Creation.

                       The first link here really is my best description of what this message is today, it's written in chalk, even though it's every word and quite a bit of modern music and art, and for sure--for sure it's lots and lots of mythology and religion. That links starts off hopefully bringing some light to the idea that Minority Report and A Scanner Darkly and Phillip K. Dick in general... link to the Matrix as part of this woven message that connects names and ideas to a map to building Heaven--beginning with ending the &quot;Plague of Killing the Firstborn Children&quot; .... and do see, that's &quot;school shootings.&quot;
