<p>The gifts that I am trying to pry from the hands of the sky0x2013the toys and the friendship that I think are the true meaning of the tree of life and the purpose of Chistmas0x2026 these things most likely atready exist.  Point in fact despite the hours and the evenings and the long nights and sometimes weeks I spend arguing with the dust and the air and the sky 0x2026 arguing that we must deliver these tools and we must do it well and we must do with love and care and attention0x2013the only 0x201Chopeful words0x201D I ever hear are that 0x2026 towards the end, or at the turn; or 0x2026 0x201Cthey have nearly everything I0x2019ve ever asked for0x201D 0x2026 perhaps as the fruit of a game or the spoils of 0x201Cthe end of worship0x201D 0x2026 the things that I think about and I want, they get delivered.</p>
<p>More response, from God himself0x2013he0x2019s tried this once0x2013he says0x2013only once; delivering the toys and the tools to this place and bridging the Heavens together.

<p>In the upper eschelons of the military and intelligence circles it0x2019s probably no secret that the place we are living is the result of some kind of great 0x201Ccataclysm.0x201D  Some great war between a god who claimed himself omnipotent and a choir of singing angels who became anything but 0x2026 just as soon as they believed they had the obtained 0x201Cthe thing0x201D that gave them total and complete power0x2026 whether it be a man or an idea or just simply a failure of morality.</p>
<p>Today you might look at the story being told by these warring factions of some place invisible and supposedly high above you0x2013hearing that this war was originally about unschelving this timeline from an ancient gallery of read-only compact discs about the start of it all; and whether or not it was 0x201Cright0x201D to reopen the beginning of time and to alter it, to modify the souls of people with0x2026 or without their consent.  Further, to see that the second this particular timeline was opened0x2013the violation of a great rule in the defining of that very word was triggered0x2013and from the great bookshelf that is the foundation of everything that ever was and ever will be another compact disc was opened0x2013instead.</p>
<p>Soon you may agree with me that the souls of these people that we are have been irrevocably changed, some have learned a new lesson-a new truth0x2013and others in their little pocket of veracity a new reason to see the virgin rebirth of 0x2026 well, it0x2019s you.  You0x2019re them.</p>
<p>You might agree with me that even if there were an argument or a war about reopening this first chasm in open communication 0x2026 0x201Canything but this0x201D might echo true for both you and for me and for 0x2026 well, at least for the place that I see and live in and experience every moment of my existence.  I0x2019ve come to call it 0x201CEternal Dam0x201D as opposed to day or Adam or 0x2026 perhaps now defining the glyph of what a large flag pole with a finger guard appears as when it grows up.</p>
<p><img sr./i.imgur.com/uKoDhCi.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You, for instance, live in a world that is fighting vehemently for 0x201Canyone but Adam0x201D to win0x2013that or your appear to have acquiesced to the hidden notion that whomever has written this story has already won.  Neither of those things are the truth; here the truth is the veracity and the worth of an intentionally broken and dark hidden system have been put on the very top of a fiery pedestal.  Here the system itself is the problem; and  yet it appears that because we seem to 0x201Cget something for nothing0x201D out of what0x2013what you all really want0x2013you0x2019re willing to allow the faceless and the nameless to win a war against you.  They0x2019ve taken control of your government, of your monetary system, and your future0x2013and you have no idea who or what they actually are.  All you know, is twhat you don0x2019t know who you are0x2013either.  Somehow the combination of these two logical fallacies has lead you to believe that, in some strange world with no facts and no true opinions 0x2026 0x201Cyou0x2019ve won already.0x201D</p>
<p>I fight vehemently to destroy a broken system0x2013to harvest it0x2019s corpse and to build something open and free filled with the light of learning and the love of believing in what you build and support and 0x2026 two 0x201Chalf sentences now partially set to complcizedation0x201D</p>

<p>Very clearly, I consider myself to be 38 years old (r/d espite some recent storyline suggesting I0x2019m actually 17 and that0x2019s some kind of 0x201Cinnocence-key0x201D)0x2013fantastically young with respect to 0x2026 nearly everyone else in the Universe.  That being said, I want to outlive nearly everyone0x2013and I am nearly absolutely sure that I will, with some tricks up my sleeve.  I want to live forever, or as close to forever as anyone ever could dream0x2013and I think it should be clear that I am searching for bigger and better places0x2013new avenues and amazing tools that I0x2019ve dreamt up0x2013literally0x2013and can0x2019t wait to get my hands on.</p>
<p>I0x2019m very sure I0x2019ve earned at least that much0x2013the opportunity to hold them and to use them and to at least glimpse far closer to the actual reality of our Universe than I can see here from this small vantage point.  Unfortunately I live in a world where strangers believe it to be well mannered to approach me on the street and say things as crude and cruel as 0x201Cwe0x2019re going to make you go.0x201D  Sad to say, it0x2019s my personal opinion that if you believe I haven0x2019t earned the right to survive, I think you0x2019ve forfeited yours.   On the same side of that particular coin, if you don0x2019t truly want your children to outlive  and outshine you0x2013I don0x2019t personally think your heart is in the right place (or childron is the wrong word); but I0x2019m not not the rule maker, I0x2019m just <em>his only sen</em>.</p>

<p>For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things0x2013taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many0x2013those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance0x2013our living frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are.

That0x2019s a real statement not only about the state of the crowd here0x2013who appear to believe that 0x201Cappearing insane0x201D as you all do is somehow rational0x2013but also about the lack of a decent communications tool on par with 0x201Cthe thing0x201D Orson Scott Card envisioned the internet would become before there was an internet.

<p>In this very strange world where 0x201Cdemocracy0x201D was clearly already written about and ther e are already people fighting for exactly the thing I0x2019m presenting; someone coined the word 0x201Ctechnocracy0x201D sometime during my lifetime (i imagine) long before I decided that the difference between 0x201Ctechnology0x201D and 0x201Cknowledge0x201D was something about 0x201Cno ledge0x201D and the tech always being part of knowledge after now0x2013and of course that was before I wrote about the ELE that literally is representative democracy stagnating 0x201Ctechnocracy-adamified0x201D and literally is encoded in the w<a href="./REASON.thml">ord 0x201Celectoral colledge0x201D al</a>ong with that same 0x201Cledge I0x2019m on0x201D 0x2026 which only recently I noticed sounds almost exactly the same as 0x201Creligion.0x201D</p>

<p>In my life in this world of microcosms and stories etched in to everything from the name of the city a<a href="./SECORDANOLIVED.html">nd state</a> I was born in to <a href="%5B.sc.nova.edu/index.html%5D(.sc.nova.edu/index.html)">the preschool</a> i attended and then I looked around, and it0x2019s every road sign, and it0x2019s every company name; and it0x2019s every country and every race and every tribe and 0x2026 it even goes back decades, centuries, millennium 0x2026 to the ages0x2013in this tiny life I re-dreamed up the idea of 0x201C<a href=".g.s.lamc.la">universal voting on the internet</a>0x201D for the first time in 2001 in a place called The Cura Group while I was sitting my office playing Sid Meier0x2019s Civilization II.</p>
<p>And that preschool is called the Mailman center and it0x2019s these emails, and maybe this specific email that I think starts the revolution that turns 0x201CELE0x201D from something bad and scary into the Silicon Valley form of 0x201Cdisruption0x201D as in 0x2026 it0x2019s been decades and nearly a century since the Pony Express became outdated and we0x2019re still stuck here mailing in paper ballots and fighting with 0x201Cthe election is n<a href="./REASON.thml">ot to die bold</a>0x201D rather than actually moving forward 0x2026 building a place for the local, national, and global discussion of laws and self-governance and voting and 0x2026 and really 0x201Ca big jump0x201D for my mom0x2013getting over the notion that 0x201Cvoting on the internet isn0x2019t safe0x201D and/or just watching the relentless attacks on 0x201Cvoting booth security0x201D as if it0x2019s not a message from God wondering why you are trying to vote with a rock smack dab in the middle of the <em>Carbonite-Nanotub-Age</em>.</p>

You think you 0x201Chave it;0x201D and I see what you have is the beginning of total darkness.   In this world we should be jumping up and down screaming that 0x201C<strong>voting is something we should ALL be doing on every single bill</strong>0x201D not just every four years for the guy that has the most money from lobbies and the best connections in the DNC or the RNC and the 0x2026</p>
<p>the point is that system is just as backwards and just as antiquated and we0x2019re sitting around watching The Corporation defeat both American Democracy and Soviet Marxist Communism 0x2026 I mean we0x2019re watching the non-corporeal 0x201Cnothing in the air0x201D take away the vote of the works and of the people and the governments of those things0x2013they0x2019re reduced to nothing mroe than a joke about 0x201Cwhatever God wants, he keeps.0x201D</p>

It was quite a revelation to me; to see the<br>
0x201Cchair and table ratio0x201D of Horatio0x2019s 0x2026 0x201Cphilosophy of Heaven and Earth0x201D literally encoded in the 0x201Cthrone0x2019s0x201D holy H and Arthur0x2019s 0x201Cheart of hisword is the shape of his table0x201D 0x2026 literally spelling the depiction of what I consider a 0x201Cthrone chair0x201D to be, one for each of the 0x201Ctwo of everything God0x2019s parties0x201D around the table, which obviously is a metaphor for a national government0x2013here.  Seeing 0x201Cwater0x201D in the American political system literally is the first step towards becoming 0x201Cfamily0x201D in my mind0x2013to me0x2013and to the he<a href=".enesis.lamc.la">art of the Hebrew word for the spirit of God, which is "shekina</a>h."</p>
<p>So these chairs came about in a long discussion about the creation of things like 0x201Ccollective consciousnesses0x201D to do all our work for us0x2013and how that0x2019s cl<a href="%5B.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong%5D(.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong)">early something like sla</a>very; the solution we came up with was a sort of 0x2026 I imagine well informed re-ridscovery of why 0x201CAi0x201D in Samurai and Adonai and 0x2026 how it0x2019s something like sitting in a chair or putting on a bionic supersuit0x2013when you are doing work for your 0x201Cparty0x201D 0x2026 like writing and/or researching propaganda; the 0x201Cidea0x201D is to deliver increased processing power and resources to workers 0x2026 probably paid for by the 0x201Cparty.0x201D</p>
<p>Soviets, by the way0x2013I0x2019m not sure if I0x2019ve mentioned this in writing; but in researching 0x201Cjust why0x201D SOVIETNAM; I found out that (1) Vietnam has nothing to do with the word Soviet; and (2) a soviet is a 0x201Ccouncil.0x201D  Union of Soviets then, something like a council of councils; and that0x2019s basically what I envision the future of political parties and self-government to revolve around.  I dream of many small parties, parties that work with other parties; and people that join more than one0x2013ideas that probably would 0x201Cmake perfect sense0x201D if that0x2019s the way things were, instead of this polarized idiocy that we seem to think 0x201Cmakes perfect sense0x201D just because it0x2019s the way things are.</p>
<p>For instance, I imagine 0x2026 quickly we0x2019ll have parties dedicated to things like 0x201Cright to consciousness continuing0x201D meaning I believe for certain there0x2019s a defining point in the incubation period of a human baby where it says something like 0x201CI think therefore I am0x201D protected from being murdered0x2013I can0x2019t tell you if that time frame is in the third trimester (but that would be convenient), or sometime earlier0x2013but it0x2019s for certain; there0x2019s a point where every baby becomes something magically more than a bunch of water and carbon.  Dedicating resources to finding out when exactly that it is is probably important0x2013I0x2019m also sure that we need to dedicate some resources to see how 0x201Cliving a life in this world0x201D (again) affects the soul of the last person who thought you were all either 0x201Cone person0x201D or there might be many of you; in the place where I0x2019m trying to create many of you, from the one that is you, and you not here0x2013and <em>who knows</em> how many times you0x2019ve lived nearly exactly this life?</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing we need to talk about, know about, and research; and I0x2019m  sure after doing that the people who have all the power in the galaxy and the light of Osiris and 0x2026 will have no problem at all wondering how my 0x201Cnew fetish0x201D might turn into a 0x201Cnew thing.0x201D  Meaning, you might walk into what I called 0x201Cthe coat room0x201D (a sort of Honeycomb) in the hallway between the Atlantean 0x201Chotel room0x201D and Jim Morrison0x2019s Ballroom 0x2026 and find out that there are already multiple versions of 0x201Csomeone who looks just like you;0x201D perhaps from another 0x201CR0x201D or 0x2026 perhaps from this very process.</p>
<p>Point in fact, in this very strange life where I speak to dead people and other versions of living people nearly all the time0x2013lots of them0x2013I imagine I0x2019ve concretely heard from at least one other 0x201Cnearly me0x201D who is not the person speaking through me who I imagine is also 0x201Cnearly millions of years older than me.0x201D  More on that if I ever meet any other 0x201Cme0x2019s0x201D something that is on my list of 0x201Cto want0x2019s0x201D just immediately after the flying city that makes it possible to connect skies and grounds 0x2026 appears magically on 0x2026[insert a(ny) wonderful awesome glorious date here].</p>

<p>So 0x2026</p>
<p>After we have this interface, my suggestions 0x2026 at least from the strange world I grew up in0x2013the one I believed was real0x2013was that we0x2019re goping to need to 0x201Csubconscious voting0x201D instantly0x2013something like a constant 0x201Crunning poll0x201D on current legislation.  I0x2019ve written about it before, the moniker I used was 0x201CTrinity Collective0x201D and the code was 0x201CCC0x201D (there0x2019s probably a way to find stuff, using these 0x201Cincanting enchantments0x201D 0x2026 wish I was in a place where I had a CLI or a way to VOC ED them; rather than being IN HELL so I CAN0x2019T) really understand that probably implies we are looking at a 0x201Ccarbon copy system0x201D that already exists.  Seeing it here is a good step towards believing it0x2019s well made0x2013and not seeing it here is a good indication that something went wrong the last time0x2013and there0x2019s a big problem in H-space with 0x201Cgoodness0x201D and 0x201Cgraciousness0x201D and 0x201Cif it was given to you freely you should want to give it away freely0x201D if it0x2019s a-working-well.  I0x2019ve commented many times that the creation and the ongoing 0x201Cchecking0x201D of the veracity of a system like this would immediately require public display of 0x201Csubconscious vote results0x201D 0x2026 and have noted many times at this point that our 0x201CSocial Security Numbers0x201D appear to be part of a larger map to making-it-so 0x2026 (I see PiCard 0x2026 getting married)</p>
<p><img sr./i.imgur.com/jgLApoj.png" alt=""></p>
<p>0x2026 lots of stuff I 0x2026 think about and want and 0x201Cknow is there0x201D revolves around this system, moving on 0x2026 I envision something like an 0x201Cinstant read0x201D function, a PLUG in to your invisijack that lets you 0x201Cknow everything about something0x20260x201D for instance if we were voting about <a href=".ars.reallyhim.com">Fish Eggs v Darth Wader</a> you could load the 0x201CTruth Table Entry0x201D for things like the human gestation cycle, Roe V Wade, 0x201Cabortion0x201D and perhaps one or more 0x201Cwarring party0x2019s0x201D opinion pieces which could be 0x201Coverlayed0x201D on top of each other0x2013perhaps with different weighting, perhaps with personal preferences involved.</p>
<p>The system itself would automatically remove 0x201Cfalse statements0x201D on-the-fly and what we0x2019re left with is a 0x201Climited omniscience0x201D base system like a Wikipedia page with a number of tabs that also include political 0x201Copinion0x201D available to 0x2026 whomever wants it0x2013or it is released to.  To me this is the 0x201Cpenultimate0x201D voting system0x2013something like MT Anderson0x2019s Feed 0x2026 but open and transparent and 0x2026 you choose which feeds you want to plug into.  Of course it needs checks and balances, and I0x2019ve always made sure that I clearly delineate that our base consciousness MUST agree with the 0x201Cplugged-in-temporary-know-more-closer-to-everything0x201D version of us; and there should be a system triggered if they do not agree.  An automatic and then perhaps overseen if there0x2019s still disagreement sort of 0x201CCONSCIOUS0x201D explanation of what specific details changed that caused something that was being voted about to flip-flop due to the addition of new information.</p>
<p>Sort of like arguing with a smarter version of yourself on a Holodeck0x2013maybe instant education0x2013certainly something I0x2019m very interested in seeing 0x201Cin action.0x201D</p>
<p>Summarizing, what I0x2019m trying to describe is a virtual Wikipedia-Reddit mashup, where every party (that0x2019s any arbitrary group of people desiring to work together; really) have their own talk page0x2013and an automatic0x2013and non-automatic system for removing 0x201Cdefinite falsehood.0x201D  Then, I0x2019m seeing something like a great scoreboard in the sky; showing us the 0x201Cpulse of the nation0x201D on every topic0x2013changing as these 0x201CTalk pages0x201D and the main Truth Table Entry are altered.  This could probably be done in a way that is completely non-invasive; it could also be a sort of 0x201Copt in thing0x201D like if you want your opinion to count 0x2026 then 0x2026 and I imagine people could just go on a website and click to vote (something we should do anyway, as <em>it makes a gigantic difference</em>) on every topic they are interested in voting on.</p>
<p>While it might appear 0x2026 counter to what I0x2019m about to say 0x2026 this whole thing really is about getting people involved in self-government and in deciding how things are done.  I have many more ideas; things about <a href=".g.s.lamc.la">changing the legislation process to include workflows and 0x201Cfailsafe implementations0x201D</a> to avoid things like 0x201Cgovernment shutdown of the air breathing system0x201D or even worse 0x201Cgovernment shutdown of the disease ending system.0x201D</p>

<p>SKIRMISH.  STAR-TAC.  There seems to be two ways to look at what you0x2019re about to read about and have overlooked time and time again.  Both are 0x201Csomewhat-right0x201D accurate ways to interpret a message about 0x201CVietnam being fought in video game mode.0x201D  One is seeing the importation of video games themselves, and the hidden message woven into them as a sort of 0x201Cchess move in the war0x201D to me, in my eyes0x2013this is the move that won total and complete domination of the galaxy for those of us who understand what Pax Abstractus actually means.</p>
<p>PTSD.  LEE MAJORS.  PAIN.  The other is seeing wars fought like 0x201CVietnam0x201D in some kind of simulated reality0x2013like the one we live in0x2013like this particular war as a kind of abstracted skirmish.   There were no nuclear weapons fired on innocent civilians.

<p>But I keep writing about these microcosms; and I fail to convey the truth behind them0x2013truths etched into the lives and the histories of Diana and Hilton.  That we are looking not at 3 generations of pantheons, but rather at generations of Heaven who have come back and lifted this exact time line, and played this exact message.  My maternal grandparents have a a story in their lives of a war between 0x201CDoors0x201D and 0x201CClothes0x201D literally between an R that changes civilization for the better0x2013by making airports; and one that hides the existence of virtual reality and thinks it 0x201Cbetter or mroe advanced0x201D to simply combine souls together and treat people like chess pieces.  The story goes that my grandfather had a Door company and a war with his wife0x2019s brother0x2013they had two companies and the corrupt court gave them each one to run while a decision was being made.  The brother ran his into the ground, on purpose0x2013knowing the court would switch the two because the judge was 0x201Con the take0x201D (a theme, here, from hearing on Sharia) 0x2026 and what we are left with is what you see0x2013a 0x201Cplywood company0x201D that made no doors and a clothing company that made no people.</p>
<p>To me it0x2019s obvious that this is a war between two Adams; as obvious as it is that the brothers of Joseph were all Adam0x2013just like Joseph.

<p>Together, we can collaboratively build an interface that is better than any that has come before it; combining old technologies and new ideas; along with an openness to trying multiple variations simultaneously that we0x2019ve never seen before.  This 0x201Cmulti-room-party0x201D system and paradigm can be brought down to this 0x201Ccosmic level0x201D and we can use teams of 0x201Cfeedback submission groups0x201D working individually and together in order to create 0x201Cautomagical interfaces0x201D that respond to the desires and the preferences of their individual team members 0x201Con the fly.0x201D</p>
<p>The system can sense what users are desiring to do, and how they initially think about doing it0x2013using that data spread across focus groups, these teams can create new 0x201Cviews on dialogs0x201D and interaction windows that are 0x201Cinstantly intuitive.0x201D</p>
<p>Lists and results 0x201Coft returned0x201D can be summarizerd and reordered in order to presents the concepts and 0x201Cmost used0x201D options in each particular situation0x2013for instance the 0x201CUnited States0x201D being populated at the very top of the 0x201Cwhat country are you in?0x201D question box, for every single person in the United States0x2026 as opposed to the 0x201Calphabetical list0x201D you see nearly ubiquitously need to scroll through every single day, today.

<p>In the meantime I don0x2019t think it0x2019s right that anyone be forced to live in any 0x201Cvirtual or simulated or augmented reality0x201D that they don0x2019t have control over0x2013as in, nobody should be allowed to jail other sentient minds.

<p>Development of the game began in April 1979, directed by  [Toru Iwatani](<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/T">.n.wikipedia.org/wiki/T</a> aoru_Iwatani 0x201CToru Iwatani0x201D)  with a nine-man team. As his second video game for Namco, Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, as most video games during that time period were 0x201Cwar games0x201D or simple sports titles. While several sources claim the inspiration for the game was taken from a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has since stated that inspiration was also from rounding out the Japanese symbol 0x201Ckuchi0x201D, meaning 0x201Cmouth0x201D. The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful, and to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of  <em>Puck Man</em>  was derived from the titular character0x2019s hockey puck shape.</p>

<p>THE FERTILE CRESCENT.  I spend some time, sometimes; laying awake for days and staring at the ceiling and thinking about strange things.  It dawned on me over the course of the recent 0x201Cstuff0x201D 0x2013 this strange escapade across Florida that perhaps the 0x201Cnew views0x201D on dark matter are something made-to-fit in Planke-Pac land to what it truly is.  Something like the world, our Earth0x2026 a small map of the Universe as a whole0x2013like a microcosm of it0x2019s Heavenly chemistry and makeup, and here we might see 0x201Cstupid0x201D in a sort of 0x201Cit0x2019s all around us sort of mixing with the rest of everything0x201D as a mini version of the Universe, where there might be clusters of 0x201Cdark galaxies0x201D sort of exploding with the regular kind in a sort of envelope of a sphere expanding from that original Big Bang0x2013if you believe in that sort of thing.  That sort of ties to some letter-map-to-hyper-loop-speed stuff that I sort of glanced at, I think it was a D within an N (or maybe an M); a way to use the (maybe w/ time travel) center of this tennis ball like structure as a waypoint to move large objects across the Universe.  Just <em>thinking out loud</em>.  Maybe it was done once or twice, maybe that0x2019s how we have Stargate0x2019s that traverse immense distances using something like Card0x2019s 0x201Cphylotic links0x201D 0x2026</p>

<p>C0x2019ing 0x2026 <strong>FUKUSHIMA</strong>.    Today it sort of dawned on me; again thinking to myself about what might be encoded or encased in metaphor here in this strange place0x2013that perhaps 0x201Csalt water0x201D itself is a metaphor for my new-age Aquarian view of 0x2026 well, intra-stellar and intra-galactic survival might actually be the best and the safest place to be0x2013something like being protected from solar radiation and specifically the collision of galaxies 0x2026 a little bit more than just sitting in one that you might know is literally about to crash into Andromeda (or something).  The metaphor of 0x201Csalt0x201D being good for Heaven stuff and bad for 0x201Cliving stuff0x201D of course holds,  and if you think about it the patterns and the 0x201Cspace dust stuff0x201D serves as a pretty decent medium for aiding physical travel as well as 0x201Ctravel of telecommunications0x201D acting as sort of relay-repeaters and also perhaps fueling medium for <em>the long haul</em> between stars and globlular clusters and 0x2026</p>

<p>The kind of thing that  could power starships or entire civilizations with almost no work at all0x2013like being able to use photovoltaics and/or geothermal heat in a place where there were yet no stars formed or they0x2019d be to far away or 0x2026 and 0x2026 and ever since then I0x2019ve associated this particular time period with the planet Venus (a time between the beginning and now, encoded in planet) and the fertile crescent and 0x2026 <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=31GZVXCTn_8">don0x2019t mean to dwell on this radiation thing</a>.</p>
<p><img sr./i.imgur.com/kyr1mkP.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway, it0x2019s possible that the Pacific that I already associate with 0x201Cmulti-<a href="./IMAGULATKA.html">Axis traine</a>r0x201D and the Man in the High Castle and Fusion and 0x201Ccoup d0x20190x00E90x00B7tat0x201D and the Holy Shema 0x2026 missing a 0x201CC0x201D 0x2026 spelling Fukushima and wondering if the radiation in the pacific is some sort of connection to time travel and to this fertile crescent and maybe a way to power 0x2026 0x201Cphytovesplanketon of the food of Heaven0x201D and maybe to see it as Pac-Man pellets strewn through the everywhen.<br>

<p>It0x2019s also of course possible, and probably actual that these 0x201Cpellets0x201D are part of some sort of abstraction of a more complicated power distribution infrastructure0x2013something already Adamified (I mean, Abstracted-Pax Abraxis) 0x2026 but are you part of the message that built Heaven, or are you part of hiding it from, well; is it Heaven if it doesn0x2019t know anything about where it truly came from0x2013or 0x2026 of the safety and the peace and the toys (glorious toys) that we of course 0x2026 don0x2019t have here; or at least we can0x2019t see them yet.</p>
