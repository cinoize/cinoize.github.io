I built a PC back in college (with the help of some friends), and ever since then I've continued perfecting my home office setup—switching desks, keyboards, monitors, and more.\n\n+++\n\nWhen many of my friends and colleagues were forced to quarantine because of the [novel coronavirus pandemic](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-a-coronavirus/), I realized most people don't have home workstations like mine. So, my fellow folks privileged enough to be able to work from home during this crisis, below are some picks that might make working from home more bearable. Most have been tested by WIRED's Gear team and we're recommending others based on customer reviews across retailers, what other sites have to say, and our experience with the brand.\n\n*When you buy something using the links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission.

If not, check out our [Best Laptops](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-laptops/), [Best Cheap Laptops](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cheap-laptops/), and [Best MacBooks](https://www.wired.com/story/which-macbook-should-you-buy/) guides. If you're eyeing a desktop PC, we have recommendations for [prebuilt gaming PCs](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-gaming-desktop-pcs/) that might be handy, or you can [build your own](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-build-a-pc/) for a lot less.\n\nHere are a few of our favorites:\n\n- **[MacBook Air (2020) for $1,299](https://apple.sjv.io/GNAOm){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Apple's newest MacBook is the [best for most people](https://www.wired.com/review/apple-macbook-air-2020/). Get the Intel Core i5 model to make sure you have enough power for most tasks. For more details check out our review ([8/10, WIRED Recommends](https://www.wired.com/review/apple-macbook-air-2020/)).\n  \n  \n- **[Lenovo ThinkBook 13S for $668](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Thinkbook-Anti-Glare-1920x1080-Fingerprint/dp/B081382ZF2/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This isn't the best Windows laptop out there, but it's our top pick if you're [looking for something affordable](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cheap-laptops/). WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson said it has great speakers, a good keyboard, as well as a fingerprint reader and a physical privacy shutter for the webcam.\n  \n  \n- **[Pixelbook Go for $850](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/xdzv1){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you can do all your work via a browser and that browser happens to be Chrome, then you should consider a Chromebook. You can find more affordable Chromebooks, but the Pixelbook Go (specifically the Core i5 model) doesn't skimp on performance.\n  \n  \n\n### Great Desks\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5dc5b013c955950008b267b9]\n\nA workstation starts with a good desk, and sometimes that means one that can convert into a standing desk so that you're not sitting all day.\n\n- **[Fully Jarvis Standing Desk for $449\\+](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is our favorite standing desk with an adjustable height via the motor (and up to four height presets), tested by WIRED reviews editor Jeffrey Van Camp and featured in [our WFH gift guide](https://www.wired.com/gallery/work-from-home-gift-ideas/). He likes the eco-friendly bamboo top, and there are also tons of ways to customize it to your liking.\n  \n  \n- **[VertDesk V3 standing desk for $568\\+](https://www.btod.com/btod-vertdesk.php){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This standing desk comes recommended from [WIRED senior editor Michael Calore](https://www.wired.com/story/head-to-head-standing-desks-comparison-guide/). It moves up and down, and holds up to 275 pounds so you can have multiple monitors on the desk. It's infinitely customizable—go crazy and add a keyboard tray, monitor arm, power strips, casters, and more.\n  \n  \n- **[A more standard computer desk for $135](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DB8PX1S/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a simple desk that can be put together in five minutes out of the box. There are a few size options (I have the 62-inch model) and while it doesn't have the highest quality materials (it uses particle wood board for the table), it has a sturdy frame, looks minimalist, *and* it's affordable.\n  \n  \n\n### Relaxing Chairs\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e1f6dbf6460008b11b91]\n\nNo workstation is complete without a comfortable chair to ease into. Here are a few the Gear team has tried and like.\n\n- **[Staples Hyken Mesh Task Chair for $160](https://fave.co/2WWaNQL){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Reviews Editor Jeffrey Van Camp says he personally tried \"all the chairs at all the stores\" last year and this is his favorite—and now sits at his desk. It reclines, has neck support if you need it, and the mesh holds up.\n  \n  \n- **[Staples Ardfield Mesh Back Fabric Task Chair for $130](https://fave.co/39A6BsY){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This chair (another recommendation from Jeffrey) might not last a lifetime as your main chair, but it comes in a variety of colors and frequently dips below $100.\n  \n  \n- **[AmazonBasics Mid-Back Desk Office Chair for $63](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/dp/B00IIFW2L4?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** WIRED writer Louryn Strampe says this chair from Amazon isn't mind-blowing but it's cheap and worked for her secondary workstation set up in her home. It's fully adjustable, too.\n  \n  \n- **[Ferrino Line Gaming and Lifestyle Chair by RapidX for $300](https://www.amazon.com/Ferrino-Patterned-Lifestyle-not-machine-specific/dp/B01KLSIW50?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** My partner and I have been using a pair of these chairs for four years now and they've held up incredibly well. It's comfortable, the artificial leather feels high quality, and it reclines quite a bit.\n  \n  \n\n### A Laptop Stand Also Helps\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5a6a75e1eb1c6a70a2aeeb8a]\n\nThe benefit of using a laptop is that you *don't* need to be confined to a desk. And when you work from home, sometimes a change of scenery feels necessary. A stand will help add stability, wherever you are.\n\n- **[Rain Design mStand Laptop Stand for $40](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F01DRW6/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This simple stand needs a sturdy surface like a coffee table, but it's affordable, attractive, and highly rated by buyers across multiple retailers. There's also a cutout on the back where you can pull cables through for maximum organization.\n  \n  \n- **[Neetto Height Adjustable Laptop Table for $55](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8FH7QB/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This one isn't as pretty, but it comes recommended from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21175214/adjustable-laptop-table-laptop-stand-strategist) and has top marks on Amazon. It's adjustable, cheaper, and the better choice if you often find yourself on the couch watching Netflix's *[Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness](https://www.wired.com/story/tiger-king-coronavirus-covid-19/)* while working.\n  \n  \n- **[Grovemade Walnut Laptop Stand for $140](https://grovemade.com/product/walnut-laptop-stand/?initial=136){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a beautiful laptop stand, and yes, it's expensive, but I love every minute I use it. It's best suited for a desk or table—to make room for a keyboard and mouse. There's a stainless steel stop to keep your laptop from sliding off and the feet are made of cork so it doesn't move around.\n  \n  \n\n### A Monitor Can Do Wonders\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e23ca231050008135fd3]\n\nA monitor is one of those things that will dramatically improve your work experience at home. They're selling out across several retailers at the moment, so you may have a hard time snagging one. These are some good options still in stock.\n\n- **[HP 24EA 24-Inch HD monitor for $130](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/gdN32){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This simple 1080p monitor will do the job for most people and it's pretty affordable. It doesn't have any bells or whistles, but it's relatively slim and the stand doesn't take much room. It doesn't come with a VESA mount so if you wanted to mount it, you'd [need an adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Mount-Adapter-Monitors-Patent-Pending/dp/B078MN77TD?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n  \n  \n- **[AOC 24-Inch mountable HD monitor for $150](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/xdb7d){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a solid 1080p monitor for the price, but you might need your own HDMI cable as it only comes with a VGA cable in the box. This is the better choice if you want to mount it as it's VESA compatible.\n  \n  \n- **[Dell S2719DM 27-Inch QHD monitor for $400](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8984107/type/dlg/sid/workfromhomeguide/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/210-arcv){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This monitor is bigger, has a very slim profile, a higher 1440p pixel resolution, and even supports HDR for better colors in supported apps. You're stuck with two HDMI ports but that should be fine for most people It's well-rated online, and [Laptop Mag gave it high marks](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/monitors/dell-ultrathin-s2719dm-monitor).\n  \n  \n- **[LG 34-Inch ultrawide monitor for $377](https://fave.co/3aA9M4V){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you're frequently in front of a monitor and still find yourself craving more screen space, consider an ultrawide. Reviews Editor Jeffrey Van Camp recommends this model from LG, which has a 2,560 x 1,080 pixel resolution, HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, and a speedy response time (handy if you also play fast-paced videogames). Ultrawide monitors open up new worlds of multitasking, letting you run two full-size browser windows side-by-side (or another application), which is why several members of the Gear team have one (including me\\!).\n  \n  \n\n### Mounts for Your Monitor\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5]\n\nIf you're working with limited desk space, a monitor arm mount is a great way to reclaim some of it back (plus it helps hide pesky wires\\!).\n\n- **[Workstream by Monoprice Desk Mount for $50](https://fave.co/3bw5UlC){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've been using this mount to hold up my 34-inch ultrawide monitor and it works like a charm. It's adjustable, holds up to around 20 pounds, and the arm clamps to the desk and doesn't look hideous. It uses the VESA mounting standard, so make sure the monitor you have supports it.\n  \n  \n- **[Fully Jarvis Monitor Arm for $99](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-monitor-arm.html?){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This arm mount supports the same weight as the previous one and is just as adjustable. It's VESA compatible, has a 5-year warranty, offers built-in cable management, and it's made by the same company that makes the standing desk we recommend above. Wirecutter also has it at the [top of its list](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-monitor-arms/).\n  \n  \n\n### You Probably Need a USB Adapter\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e287798a15000821fe76]\n\nIf you're plugging in a laptop to a monitor, chances are you'll need to plug in several other items, like a keyboard, mouse, the charging cable, and maybe an SD card reader. That's where an adapter come in. Plug it into your laptop, and plug everything else into it. It's so much simpler.\n\n- **[Anker PowerExpand\\+ 7-in-1 USB-C Hub Adapter for $40](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Delivery-Ethernet-Chromebook/dp/B07PPGWQ15?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Anker products are reliable and inexpensive, and this dock recommended by WIRED contributing writer Boone Ashworth is no different. Plug the USB-C cable into the port on your laptop, and then you can plug in two USB-A devices into the dock, an Ethernet cable, a USB-C charger to juice up your laptop, a MicroSD card and SD card, as well as an HDMI cable to connect a monitor.\n  \n  \n- **[Anker PowerExpand Direct 7-in-2 USB-C Hub Adapter for $60](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-MacBook-PowerExpand-Thunderbolt-Delivery/dp/B07YZ48HCT/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Anker has a newer version specifically for MacBooks. It takes up two USB-C ports, but it can charge the laptop faster and offers Thunderbolt 3 support so you can connect it to a second monitor.\n  \n  \n- **[Vava USB-C Hub 9-in-1 Adapter for $60](https://www.amazon.com/VAVA-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet-Laptops-Grey/dp/B079GSMZ7G?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is another well-rated dock that's similar to the first one from Anker, but it has an extra USB-A port and a headphone jack.\n  \n  \n\n### Snag a Good Keyboard\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5cdd58182948ca2e63b09140]\n\nYou type all day, so you need a good keyboard. Everyone's preferences are different, and while we at WIRED love [mechanical keyboards](https://www.wired.com/story/top-3-mechanical-keyboards/), we also have other options if you want something a little more subtle.\n\n- **[Logitech K380 Wireless Keyboard for $40](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/odVzY){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a simple, cheap Bluetooth keyboard. You *do* need two AAA batteries to power it though. If you *need* a number pad, then check out [Logitech's K780 ($80)](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/2m2jG){: rel=\"nofollow\"} wireless keyboard.\n  \n  \n- **[Dell standard corded keyboard for $16](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8984107/type/dlg/sid/workfromhomeguide/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/580-admt){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a basic but good, full-size wired keyboard if you want to keep costs as low as possible. You even get volume control.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech G513 Carbon for $150](https://fave.co/2UpG64Q){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is WIRED reviewer Jess Grey's top pick in our guide to the [Best Keyboards](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-keyboards/). It's relatively quiet, and yes, there's some RGB colorful lighting here, but you can turn it off if you don't like it.\n  \n  \n- **[Ducky One 2 Mini Mechanical Keyboard for $136](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Double-Gaming-Cherry/dp/B07WQVM5RK?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you're like me, then you're positively mesmerized by small, mechanical keyboards. They're growing in popularity, [I swear](https://www.wired.com/story/top-3-tiny-compact-keyboards/)\\! This one from Ducky comes recommended by WIRED writer Boone Ashworth (not to mention the glowing raves about it around the web). My personal tiny mechanical keyboard, if you must know, is the [GK64 from KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com/products/gk64-mechanical-keyboard-64key){: rel=\"nofollow\"} with Gateron Black switches.\n  \n  \n\n### Find a Comfy Mouse\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e20c99895f6500008e52651]\n\nWorking on a laptop can feel cramped. A mouse is just more ergonomic to use than a trackpad.\n\n- **[SteelSeries Rival 110 corded mouse for $23](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305164/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSteelSeries-RIVAL-110-MOUSE%2F345634476%3Firgwc%3D1){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Gear reviewer Jess Grey says this mouse is \"much better\" than its price implies. And it's corded too, so you don't have to worry about charging it.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech G305 wireless mouse for $60](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vdWZN){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've been using this wireless mouse for several months and it has been problem-free. It's just the right size, feels nice in the hand, and has a smooth scroll wheel. It's wireless so it does take one AA battery, but I only recently swapped it out after 3 months of extensive use.\n  \n  \n- **[SteelSeries \"Sensei Ten\" corded mouse for $70](https://fave.co/2Rb19q7){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is our favorite corded mouse at the moment. It's super lightweight, ergonomic, and works well for both lefties and righties as there are buttons on both sides.\n  \n  \n- **[Dechanic Control mouse pad for $9](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ITUKWWI/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've gone through several mouse pads but this has been my favorite so far. The textured cloth feels really nice and the rubber underside keeps it in one place. It doesn't tend to get very dirty, but you can toss it in the washing machine if needed. It comes in multiple sizes and color accents.\n  \n  \n\nWe have several more mice in our guide to the [Best Gaming Mouse](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-gaming-mouse/), even if you're not a gamer.\n\n### Headphones Can Help You Focus\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e49fff08eb0008ee310c]\n\nA good pair of headphones can tune the world out. We have a *ton* of recommendations, from the [Best Wireless Headphones](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-wireless-headphones/), [Best Cheap Headphones](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-headphones-under-100/), [Best Noise-Canceling Headphones](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-noise-canceling-headphones/), and [Best Wirefree Earbuds](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-wirefree-earbuds/) guides. I've selected some of our top picks here.\n\n- **[JBL Tune 210 for $15](https://fave.co/2JwwjDW){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Cheap doesn't have to mean bad, and these earbuds are a good example. They sound solid and the cord stays straight. There's a single button you can press to control music playback or answer calls.\n  \n  \n- **[Audio-Technica ATH-M20X for $50](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/mdaQM){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** These corded cans are a bit plasticky, but they're simple, affordable, and deliver surprisingly good sound. The bass isn't too heavy so music doesn't sound muddled.\n  \n  \n- **[Sennheiser HD 6XX for $195](https://fave.co/2UMAnVH){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Sometimes you *can't* block the world out. Maybe you have kids in the next room that you need to keep an ear out for or you're waiting for a knock at the door (keep your distance\\!). If that's you, these comfortable corded headphones are the ones to buy. The open-back design lets sound in, allowing you to hear what's going on in the real-world without needing to raise a cup above your ear, but music still sounds great. The [Sennheiser HD58X](https://fave.co/2UJTOyt){: rel=\"nofollow\"} are also similar but cost a little bit less (I have them\\!).\n  \n  \n- **[Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless noise-canceling for $278](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/mdNB1){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** There's a lot of construction right outside my New York apartment, and these headphones from Sony have helped dull the noise. They sound fantastic, block out most of my surroundings, not to mention they last a really long time. They charge via USB-C and can be plugged in with a 3.5 mm headphone jack if you want to go the corded route. We gave them an [8/10, WIRED Recommends](https://www.wired.com/review/review-sony-wh1000xm3-headphones/) award and they're currently our favorite noise canceling and wireless headphones.\n  \n  \n- **[1More Stylish wirefree earbuds for $90](https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Stylish-Wireless-Earbuds-Built/dp/B07M6LP3F9/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** These are our [favorite completely wireless earbuds](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-wirefree-earbuds/). They offer great sound, solid battery life, and better comfort than most wirefree buds, at a much lower cost.\n  \n  \n- **[Apple AirPods Pro wirefree earbuds for $249](https://apple.sjv.io/xdOPv){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you want wireless earbuds, chances are you want Apple's AirPods. Don't buy the standard set. You can do much better by going for [the 1More Stylish](https://www.amazon.com/1MORE-Stylish-Wireless-Earbuds-Built/dp/B07M6LP3F9/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"} for less and they are better in every way. But if you *have* to get something from Apple, buy the AirPods Pro. They're pricey, but they have excellent noise canceling, a comfortable fit, and the microphone quality for phone calls is better. You can also use them with Android phones, though with limited features ([8/10, WIRED Recommends](https://www.wired.com/review/apple-airpods-pro/)). The Beats Powerbeats Pro also sound good.\n  \n  \n- **[JLab Audio JBuddies Studio kids headphones for $20](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kdkmM){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you have kids, it can be tough to sit in on a conference call with *Baby Shark* playing in the background. Get them these affordable headphones. They limit sound to doctor-approved 85 decibels.\n  \n  \n\n### Computer Speakers Also Work\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e395b9399f00096a2b44]\n\nIf you live alone, then you don't necessarily need headphones. Speakers will let you to blast tunes as you're cranking out work. These recommendations come from WIRED's Parker Hall, our main audio reviewer.\n\n- **[Creative Inspire T12 2.0 speakers for $55](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Inspire-T12-Multimedia-Technology/dp/B0028N6YH0/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** On a really tight budget? Try these cheap speakers from Creative, which have surprisingly powerful bass for their diminutive stature.\n  \n  \n- **[Presonus Eris E3.5 studio monitor speakers for $100](https://fave.co/2QTxgKM){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** These speakers will take up some room on your desk, but for good reason. They sound great for the price and have powerful bass.\n  \n  \n\n### A Good Webcam Helps If You Zoom\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5dc5b1e7dea30b00096c6ca6]\n\nThe webcam in your laptop probably outputs potato quality. If you're video calling often (many of us are), it might be better to get a dedicated webcam. Unfortunately, a lot of them are out of stock at the moment so you might have to check back for when they're available.\n\n- **[Aukey Full HD webcam for $45](https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Streaming-Desktop-Widescreen-Recording/dp/B07SG8DKYD/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Type webcam into Amazon's search bar and you'll find a ton from brands we've never heard of, making it hard to trust whether they'll be good, safe, and reliable. We've tried Aukey's products before and they've worked well, and this webcam has positive ratings around the web. It outputs 1080p video quality.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech C615 HD webcam for $26](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305164/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-HD-Laptop-Webcam-C615-with-Fold-and-Go-Design-360-Degree-Swivel-1080p-Camera%2F16954486){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've been using this webcam for about a year and it hasn't given me any trouble. It looks dated, but it offers 1080p HD video quality and does a decent job exposing my face against a bright window. Unfortunately, there's no privacy shutter, but since it can rotate 360 degrees, I turn the camera toward a wall when I'm done using it. It's out of stock almost everywhere but most retailers say they'll get more by the end of April.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech C920S HD webcam for $70](https://fave.co/2X0WkTF){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This webcam nets you 1080p video but better components mean even better quality; you can zoom in and still retain 1080p quality, and the autofocus is much better. There's a privacy shutter too so you can feel safe from snoopers. It's also out of stock almost everywhere.\n  \n  \n- **[Vitade 1080p webcam for $86](https://www.amazon.com/Streaming-Vitade-Computer-Conferencing-Microphone/dp/B07RRZQBRN/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a little too much to pay for a 1080p webcam, but it's honestly just about one of the few available online with positive recommendations. It *does* have a ring light to brighten up your face if you're in a dark environment.\n  \n  \n- **[This lighting kit is also helpful for $50](https://fave.co/2wLIb20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Whether you're video-calling a colleague on the other side of the world at night or you just [want to look your best](https://www.wired.com/story/video-conferencing-gets-makeover/), this compact light can help brighten things up. It's not a webcam, but works alongside one. It mounts to flat surfaces via a suction cup and has two diffusers so you can match the color tone to the light around you.\n  \n  \n\n### A Microphone Is Also Useful for Video Chats\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e3d68dd572000828b70d]\n\nYou don't *need* a microphone as the one in your laptop or wireless headphones should suffice, but if you've gotten comments on your microphone's quality in video calls, then it's a sound investment.\n\n- **[Blue Snowball Ice for $50](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/rd0ed){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Blue's microphones are notable for their quality and reliability. I've been using a Blue Yeti for more than five years, but that's more than what most people need. Get the cheaper Snowball instead. It will make a dramatic difference over your built-in microphones and it's a plug-and-play solution, no special software needed.\n  \n  \n- **[SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wired Headset for $45](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wired-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07S9886QV?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Rather than getting a dedicated microphone you can get a headset like this one with a (detachable) built-in mic, recommended by Gear team members Jeffrey Van Camp and Jess Grey. It comes in a [wireless version, too](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Playstation/dp/B07X96DFR5/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"} ([8/10, WIRED Recommends](https://www.wired.com/review/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless/)).\n  \n  \n\n### Other Helpful Gadgets\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5e84e4d9845a6c00080f0ec5]\n\nThese other miscellaneous items aren't necessary but might help your workflow.\n\n- **[UT Wire 18-Piece D-Wings cord organizer for $11](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305164/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%3Fsourceid%3Dimp_%7Bclickid%7D%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_%7Birpid%7D%26clickid%3D%7Bclickid%7D){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I hate seeing wires strewn about so I use these to keep them all tidy and organized. The adhesive is stronger than the one from other brands I've tried.\n  \n  \n- **[Brother HL-L239ODW wireless monochrome printer for $100](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/7gDEV){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you frequently print documents at the office, here's a home option. This Brother prints in black and white only, connects to your Wi-Fi so you can print wirelessly, and it can scan and copy. If you need to print in color, [this looks like a good alternative](https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L3230CDW-Providing-Wireless-Replenishment/dp/B07FMYYXZD/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}\n  \n  \n- **[Tripp Lite TLP74RB 7-Outlet surge protector for $18](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305164/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTripp-Lite-TLP74RB-7-Outlet-Surge-Protector%2F21273107){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Since you're most likely plugging in more devices than ever at home, it's a good idea to get a surge protector. This simple one from Tripp Lite should be enough. Tripp Lite offers up to $25,000 lifetime insurance for any damage to your equipment from a surge. If the LED goes out, it means it's time to replace it and Tripp Lite will give you a new one for free.\n  \n  \n- **[Post-It Flex Write Surface whiteboard for $40](https://fave.co/2Uu4Rgz){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you're like me and need a physical place to jot down your ideas (and you miss your office's whiteboard), stick this sheet to your wall. It took me less than five minutes to install, and it's easy to wipe off dry erase *or* permanent markers with some water and a cloth. Just use a ruler to cut it or you'll end up with a crooked whiteboard like me.\n  \n  \n- **[Muji pack of 5 notebooks for $13](https://www.amazon.com/MUJI-Notebook-6mm-Rule-30sheets/dp/B00I6XY068?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** You can also just use a notebook to write those ideas down. These ones from Muji are simple, affordable, and high quality.\n  \n  \n- **[Delter Coffee Press for $35](https://www.amazon.com/Delter-Coffee-Delicious-Free-100-Microfilters/dp/B07MYV1RDG?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you're used to grabbing a cup of joe on your way to the office (or at the office) every day, then you'll want to get the same fix at home. We have several options in our [Best Latte and Cappuccino Machines](https://www.wired.com/story/best-latte-and-cappuccino-machines/) and [Best Portable Coffee Makers](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-coffee-makers/) guides, and the Delter is among our favorites. The best part? After all self isolation blows over, you can take it wherever you go. You can get fresh coffee beans delivered to your door through a service like [Atlas Coffee Club](https://atlascoffeeclub.com/){: rel=\"nofollow\"}, and don't forget a grinder\\! We [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Coffee-Mill-Mini-Slim/dp/B001804CLY/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n  \n  \n- **[Malm 2-Drawer Chest from Ikea for $50](https://fave.co/39tH4Bz){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** As a gear reviewer, I need a *lot* of storage space. I used my desk at the office to store a lot of gear but at home, I have this simple two-drawer chest for my work-related things. It's easy to build, too. If a drawer is too much, consider a [desk organizer like this one](https://www.amazon.com/MobileVision-Bamboo-Desktop-Folder-Organizer/dp/B01LG21XL0/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n  \n  \n- **[Anker PowerWave II wireless charger for $40](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Qi-Certified-Charging/dp/B083BJTY2T/?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** You can plop your phone down on this wireless charging stand so you can still see the screen as you work while the phone juices up.\n  \n  \n\n### A Few Final Tips\nMake sure you set clear boundaries for when you start and stop working. Get dressed in the morning so you can feel ready for work, make sure the TV is off so you're not distracted, and when you're done for the day, turn off the computer if you can (or close all your work-related tabs). You can even disable notifications after 5 p.m. in apps like Slack. WIRED's Digital Director Brian Barrett has more tips you can read in **[How to work from home without losing your mind](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-work-from-home-without-losing-your-mind/)**.\n\nBeing at home all day can be frustrating. One thing that might help is to decorate your new workspace to your liking, whether that's adding plants (you can buy them online from places like [The Sill](https://fave.co/3dFWTsa){: rel=\"nofollow\"} or getting [Funko Pop figurines](https://fave.co/2UJltQa){: rel=\"nofollow\"} of your favorite TV and film characters. Maybe try [scented candles](https://fave.co/341WTOT){: rel=\"nofollow\"}? Keeping things organized can help.\n\nIf your eyes feel tired because you've been looking at a computer screen all day, don't feel like you have to splurge on blue-light filtering glasses. The science on whether they work [isn't quite sound](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/uncertain-science-behind-phones-blue-light-dimmer/). Instead, follow the American Optometric Association's 20-20-20 rule to [prevent digital eye strain](https://www.aoa.org/documents/infographics/SYVM2016Infographics.pdf). Every 20 minutes you should take a 20-second break to look at something up to 20 feet away. You can also try software tools to reduce the amount of blue light emitted from screens at night to see if that helps you sleep. Windows, Macs, Android, and iOS devices—even some ebook readers—have this feature.\n\nSitting all day is [not good for your health](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005). Get up and walk around more. Set a timer every 30 minutes to do some stretches or walk around. An [Apple Watch](https://apple.sjv.io/mdakO){: rel=\"nofollow\"} or [Samsung Galaxy Watch](https://fave.co/2OCbSaE){: rel=\"nofollow\"} can offer up automatic alerts on when you've been sedentary for too long. Something like the [Cubii Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Cubii-Elliptical-Bluetooth-Adjustable-Resistance/dp/B0189VJEFI?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}, while expensive, might be a good way to get the legs moving.\n\n### Stay Safe\nMake sure to check out our [many other guides](https://www.wired.com/tag/coronavirus/) that might help during this pandemic.

Reviews Editor Jeffrey Van Camp recommends this model from LG, which has a 2,560 x 1,080 pixel resolution, HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, and a speedy response time (handy if you also play fast-paced videogames). Ultrawide monitors open up new worlds of multitasking, letting you run two full-size browser windows side-by-side (or another application), which is why several members of the Gear team have one (including me!).</p></li></ul><div role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3">Mounts for Your Monitor</div><figure class="asset-embed"><div class="asset-embed__asset-container"><span class="responsive-asset asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-asset--invisible"><picture class="asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image"><noscript><img alt="The Best &#x27;Work From Home&#x27; Gear Our Home Office Tech Guide" class="responsive-image__image" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg" srcSet="https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg 1600w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg 1024w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_768%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg 768w, https://media.wired.com/photos/5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5/master/w_640%2Cc_limit/Gear-Workstream-by-Monoprice-arm-mount-SOURCE-Monoprice.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"/></noscript></picture></span></div><figcaption class="caption asset-embed__caption"><span class="caption__credit">Photograph: Monoprice </span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="grid--item grid-layout__aside"><div class="sticky-box"><div class="sticky-box__primary"><div class="ad ad--rail"><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--rail"></div></div><div data-attr-viewport-monitor="" class="recirc-most-popular-wrapper viewport-monitor-anchor"></div></div><div class="sticky-box__placeholder"></div></div></div></div><div class="row full-bleed-ad"><div class="ad ad--mid-content"><span class="ad-label">Advertisement</span><div class="ad__slot ad__slot--mid-content"></div></div></div><div class="grid grid-margins grid-items-2 grid-layout--adrail narrow"><div class="grid--item body body__container article__body grid-layout__content"><p>If you&#x27;re working with limited desk space, a monitor arm mount is a great way to reclaim some of it back (plus it helps hide pesky wires!).</p><ul><li><p><strong><a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://fave.co/3bw5UlC&quot;}" href="https://fave.co/3bw5UlC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Workstream by Monoprice Desk Mount for $50</a>:</strong> I&#x27;ve been using this mount to hold up my 34-inch ultrawide monitor and it works like a charm.

I built a PC back in college (with the help of some friends), and ever since then I've continued perfecting my home office setup—switching desks, keyboards, monitors, and more.\n\n+++\n\nWhen many of my friends and colleagues were forced to quarantine because of the [novel coronavirus pandemic](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fwhat-is-a-coronavirus\u002F), I realized most people don't have home workstations like mine. So, my fellow folks privileged enough to be able to work from home during this crisis, below are some picks that might make working from home more bearable.

There are a few size options (I have the 62-inch model) and while it doesn't have the highest quality materials (it uses particle wood board for the table), it has a sturdy frame, looks minimalist, *and* it's affordable.\n  \n  \n\n### Relaxing Chairs\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e1f6dbf6460008b11b91]\n\nNo workstation is complete without a comfortable chair to ease into.

It reclines, has neck support if you need it, and the mesh holds up.\n  \n  \n- **[Staples Ardfield Mesh Back Fabric Task Chair for $130](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F39A6BsY){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This chair (another recommendation from Jeffrey) might not last a lifetime as your main chair, but it comes in a variety of colors and frequently dips below $100.\n  \n  \n- **[AmazonBasics Mid-Back Desk Office Chair for $63](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests\u002Fdp\u002FB00IIFW2L4?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** WIRED writer Louryn Strampe says this chair from Amazon isn't mind-blowing but it's cheap and worked for her secondary workstation set up in her home.

And when you work from home, sometimes a change of scenery feels necessary. A stand will help add stability, wherever you are.\n\n- **[Rain Design mStand Laptop Stand for $40](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002Fdp\u002FB01F01DRW6\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This simple stand needs a sturdy surface like a coffee table, but it's affordable, attractive, and highly rated by buyers across multiple retailers.

It's best suited for a desk or table—to make room for a keyboard and mouse. There's a stainless steel stop to keep your laptop from sliding off and the feet are made of cork so it doesn't move around.\n  \n  \n\n### A Monitor Can Do Wonders\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e23ca231050008135fd3]\n\nA monitor is one of those things that will dramatically improve your work experience at home.

It doesn't have any bells or whistles, but it's relatively slim and the stand doesn't take much room. It doesn't come with a VESA mount so if you wanted to mount it, you'd [need an adapter](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FMount-Adapter-Monitors-Patent-Pending\u002Fdp\u002FB078MN77TD?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n  \n  \n- **[AOC 24-Inch mountable HD monitor for $150](https:\u002F\u002Fbestbuy.7tiv.net\u002Fxdb7d){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a solid 1080p monitor for the price, but you might need your own HDMI cable as it only comes with a VGA cable in the box. This is the better choice if you want to mount it as it's VESA compatible.\n  \n  \n- **[Dell S2719DM 27-Inch QHD monitor for $400](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.anrdoezrs.net\u002Flinks\u002F8984107\u002Ftype\u002Fdlg\u002Fsid\u002Fworkfromhomeguide\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.dell.com\u002Fen-us\u002Fshop\u002Faccessories\u002Fapd\u002F210-arcv){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This monitor is bigger, has a very slim profile, a higher 1440p pixel resolution, and even supports HDR for better colors in supported apps.

Reviews Editor Jeffrey Van Camp recommends this model from LG, which has a 2,560 x 1,080 pixel resolution, HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, and a speedy response time (handy if you also play fast-paced videogames). Ultrawide monitors open up new worlds of multitasking, letting you run two full-size browser windows side-by-side (or another application), which is why several members of the Gear team have one (including me\\!).\n  \n  \n\n### Mounts for Your Monitor\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e25fd036ef00088bfbc5]\n\nIf you're working with limited desk space, a monitor arm mount is a great way to reclaim some of it back (plus it helps hide pesky wires\\!).\n\n- **[Workstream by Monoprice Desk Mount for $50](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F3bw5UlC){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've been using this mount to hold up my 34-inch ultrawide monitor and it works like a charm. It's adjustable, holds up to around 20 pounds, and the arm clamps to the desk and doesn't look hideous. It uses the VESA mounting standard, so make sure the monitor you have supports it.\n  \n  \n- **[Fully Jarvis Monitor Arm for $99](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.fully.com\u002Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html?){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This arm mount supports the same weight as the previous one and is just as adjustable. It's VESA compatible, has a 5-year warranty, offers built-in cable management, and it's made by the same company that makes the standing desk we recommend above. Wirecutter also has it at the [top of its list](https:\u002F\u002Fthewirecutter.com\u002Freviews\u002Fbest-monitor-arms\u002F).\n  \n  \n\n### You Probably Need a USB Adapter\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e287798a15000821fe76]\n\nIf you're plugging in a laptop to a monitor, chances are you'll need to plug in several other items, like a keyboard, mouse, the charging cable, and maybe an SD card reader. That's where an adapter come in. Plug it into your laptop, and plug everything else into it. It's so much simpler.\n\n- **[Anker PowerExpand\\+ 7-in-1 USB-C Hub Adapter for $40](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAnker-PowerExpand-Delivery-Ethernet-Chromebook\u002Fdp\u002FB07PPGWQ15?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Anker products are reliable and inexpensive, and this dock recommended by WIRED contributing writer Boone Ashworth is no different.

It takes up two USB-C ports, but it can charge the laptop faster and offers Thunderbolt 3 support so you can connect it to a second monitor.\n  \n  \n- **[Vava USB-C Hub 9-in-1 Adapter for $60](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FVAVA-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet-Laptops-Grey\u002Fdp\u002FB079GSMZ7G?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is another well-rated dock that's similar to the first one from Anker, but it has an extra USB-A port and a headphone jack.\n  \n  \n\n### Snag a Good Keyboard\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5cdd58182948ca2e63b09140]\n\nYou type all day, so you need a good keyboard.

You can also use them with Android phones, though with limited features ([8\u002F10, WIRED Recommends](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Freview\u002Fapple-airpods-pro\u002F)). The Beats Powerbeats Pro also sound good.\n  \n  \n- **[JLab Audio JBuddies Studio kids headphones for $20](https:\u002F\u002Fbestbuy.7tiv.net\u002FkdkmM){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you have kids, it can be tough to sit in on a conference call with *Baby Shark* playing in the background. Get them these affordable headphones. They limit sound to doctor-approved 85 decibels.\n  \n  \n\n### Computer Speakers Also Work\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e395b9399f00096a2b44]\n\nIf you live alone, then you don't necessarily need headphones. Speakers will let you to blast tunes as you're cranking out work. These recommendations come from WIRED's Parker Hall, our main audio reviewer.\n\n- **[Creative Inspire T12 2.0 speakers for $55](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FCreative-Inspire-T12-Multimedia-Technology\u002Fdp\u002FB0028N6YH0\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** On a really tight budget?

They sound great for the price and have powerful bass.\n  \n  \n\n### A Good Webcam Helps If You Zoom\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5dc5b1e7dea30b00096c6ca6]\n\nThe webcam in your laptop probably outputs potato quality. If you're video calling often (many of us are), it might be better to get a dedicated webcam. Unfortunately, a lot of them are out of stock at the moment so you might have to check back for when they're available.\n\n- **[Aukey Full HD webcam for $45](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAUKEY-Streaming-Desktop-Widescreen-Recording\u002Fdp\u002FB07SG8DKYD\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Type webcam into Amazon's search bar and you'll find a ton from brands we've never heard of, making it hard to trust whether they'll be good, safe, and reliable. We've tried Aukey's products before and they've worked well, and this webcam has positive ratings around the web. It outputs 1080p video quality.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech C615 HD webcam for $26](https:\u002F\u002Fgoto.walmart.com\u002Fc\u002F1305164\u002F565706\u002F9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-HD-Laptop-Webcam-C615-with-Fold-and-Go-Design-360-Degree-Swivel-1080p-Camera%2F16954486){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** I've been using this webcam for about a year and it hasn't given me any trouble. It looks dated, but it offers 1080p HD video quality and does a decent job exposing my face against a bright window. Unfortunately, there's no privacy shutter, but since it can rotate 360 degrees, I turn the camera toward a wall when I'm done using it. It's out of stock almost everywhere but most retailers say they'll get more by the end of April.\n  \n  \n- **[Logitech C920S HD webcam for $70](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F2X0WkTF){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This webcam nets you 1080p video but better components mean even better quality; you can zoom in and still retain 1080p quality, and the autofocus is much better. There's a privacy shutter too so you can feel safe from snoopers. It's also out of stock almost everywhere.\n  \n  \n- **[Vitade 1080p webcam for $86](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FStreaming-Vitade-Computer-Conferencing-Microphone\u002Fdp\u002FB07RRZQBRN\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** This is a little too much to pay for a 1080p webcam, but it's honestly just about one of the few available online with positive recommendations. It *does* have a ring light to brighten up your face if you're in a dark environment.\n  \n  \n- **[This lighting kit is also helpful for $50](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F2wLIb20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Whether you're video-calling a colleague on the other side of the world at night or you just [want to look your best](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fvideo-conferencing-gets-makeover\u002F), this compact light can help brighten things up. It's not a webcam, but works alongside one. It mounts to flat surfaces via a suction cup and has two diffusers so you can match the color tone to the light around you.\n  \n  \n\n### A Microphone Is Also Useful for Video Chats\n\n\n[#image: \u002Fphotos\u002F5e84e3d68dd572000828b70d]\n\nYou don't *need* a microphone as the one in your laptop or wireless headphones should suffice, but if you've gotten comments on your microphone's quality in video calls, then it's a sound investment.\n\n- **[Blue Snowball Ice for $50](https:\u002F\u002Fbestbuy.7tiv.net\u002Frd0ed){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Blue's microphones are notable for their quality and reliability. I've been using a Blue Yeti for more than five years, but that's more than what most people need. Get the cheaper Snowball instead. It will make a dramatic difference over your built-in microphones and it's a plug-and-play solution, no special software needed.\n  \n  \n- **[SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wired Headset for $45](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FSteelSeries-Arctis-Wired-Gaming-Headset\u002Fdp\u002FB07S9886QV?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** Rather than getting a dedicated microphone you can get a headset like this one with a (detachable) built-in mic, recommended by Gear team members Jeffrey Van Camp and Jess Grey.

This simple one from Tripp Lite should be enough. Tripp Lite offers up to $25,000 lifetime insurance for any damage to your equipment from a surge. If the LED goes out, it means it's time to replace it and Tripp Lite will give you a new one for free.\n  \n  \n- **[Post-It Flex Write Surface whiteboard for $40](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F2Uu4Rgz){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** If you're like me and need a physical place to jot down your ideas (and you miss your office's whiteboard), stick this sheet to your wall. It took me less than five minutes to install, and it's easy to wipe off dry erase *or* permanent markers with some water and a cloth. Just use a ruler to cut it or you'll end up with a crooked whiteboard like me.\n  \n  \n- **[Muji pack of 5 notebooks for $13](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FMUJI-Notebook-6mm-Rule-30sheets\u002Fdp\u002FB00I6XY068?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** You can also just use a notebook to write those ideas down.

I used my desk at the office to store a lot of gear but at home, I have this simple two-drawer chest for my work-related things. It's easy to build, too. If a drawer is too much, consider a [desk organizer like this one](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FMobileVision-Bamboo-Desktop-Folder-Organizer\u002Fdp\u002FB01LG21XL0\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n  \n  \n- **[Anker PowerWave II wireless charger for $40](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAnker-Wireless-PowerWave-Qi-Certified-Charging\u002Fdp\u002FB083BJTY2T\u002F?tag=w050b-20){: rel=\"nofollow\"}:** You can plop your phone down on this wireless charging stand so you can still see the screen as you work while the phone juices up.\n  \n  \n\n### A Few Final Tips\nMake sure you set clear boundaries for when you start and stop working. Get dressed in the morning so you can feel ready for work, make sure the TV is off so you're not distracted, and when you're done for the day, turn off the computer if you can (or close all your work-related tabs). You can even disable notifications after 5 p.m. in apps like Slack. WIRED's Digital Director Brian Barrett has more tips you can read in **[How to work from home without losing your mind](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002Fstory\u002Fhow-to-work-from-home-without-losing-your-mind\u002F)**.\n\nBeing at home all day can be frustrating. One thing that might help is to decorate your new workspace to your liking, whether that's adding plants (you can buy them online from places like [The Sill](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F3dFWTsa){: rel=\"nofollow\"} or getting [Funko Pop figurines](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F2UJltQa){: rel=\"nofollow\"} of your favorite TV and film characters. Maybe try [scented candles](https:\u002F\u002Ffave.co\u002F341WTOT){: rel=\"nofollow\"}? Keeping things organized can help.\n\nIf your eyes feel tired because you've been looking at a computer screen all day, don't feel like you have to splurge on blue-light filtering glasses. The science on whether they work [isn't quite sound](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wired.com\u002F2017\u002F03\u002Funcertain-science-behind-phones-blue-light-dimmer\u002F). Instead, follow the American Optometric Association's 20-20-20 rule to [prevent digital eye strain](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aoa.org\u002Fdocuments\u002Finfographics\u002FSYVM2016Infographics.pdf). Every 20 minutes you should take a 20-second break to look at something up to 20 feet away. You can also try software tools to reduce the amount of blue light emitted from screens at night to see if that helps you sleep. Windows, Macs, Android, and iOS devices—even some ebook readers—have this feature.\n\nSitting all day is [not good for your health](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mayoclinic.org\u002Fhealthy-lifestyle\u002Fadult-health\u002Fexpert-answers\u002Fsitting\u002Ffaq-20058005).
