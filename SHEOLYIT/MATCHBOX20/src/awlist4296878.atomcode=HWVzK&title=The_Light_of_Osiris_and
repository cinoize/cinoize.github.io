Above you you will find a link to the Matchbox.. the series of e-mails which I believe are going to start this fire.If yu (sic) are new to "n" (I'm Y-its-ha'ck) I recommend starting here:The Burning BushAD (that's "n") on Artificial Intelligence (that's AD-on-Ai)...

"authority."The true nature of RaelityEmail #36 ***Within these walls, you will find tacit proof of Creation, and a guide... to building Heaven.Below, a recently republished video from March 25, 2013.To start, if there were a choice, nobody would have
broken this seal.  Contained in this video is my pre-epiphany analysis of the Seals of Revelation... and an explanation of the 100 Year Prophesy which predicts the Second Coming to begin... well, right now.  You might see it as self-fulfilling... I guess it is.This video was created on 3/25/2013... just before the height of the religious experience which has produced the Revelation that has probably you here.  I find it fascinating to
see how much my perception and analysis have changed in just these few short years.  I now have an entirely new understanding of the first 4 seals. I still think much of this is valid, but am presenting it as a gauge of the change of belief that divine inspiration can bring.  I do believe this is a good take on what might be the breaking  of the 7th Seal of Revelation.  As Shaggy sung... "it wasn't
me."I should note that I am not anti-capitalism.  I am against allowing currency to determine what is right and wrong.  Morality and efficiency are not equivalent. The details of the 12/12/12 prediction of the next few weeks as the timeframe for the Second Coming is also here http://bit.ly/1TPYYUi. and originally published and
archived here (on reddit).  There you will notice the "not mentioned date" of 7/21 has just passed, and is the Summer Solstice.  It's also in an old book of mine, Timelike Synchronicity, which is one of the better ones.Good morning :)

Read this message as if the fate of the Universe depended on it.These pictures highlight an
Egyptian concept, the Ka and Ba--a union of mind and soul that we humorously call "oneness" in western religion.  In Egypt there is a much more robust record of what we might call a "history of Gods" that relates directly to Greek and Abrahamic myth.  From Atum-Ra (guess), to P'tah (clearly Peter?) to a story of Uniting Two Lands--that is (obvious to me) as the un-parting of a great Holy Sea.  I think that's happening now, and I
think Har-wer is here.  Note "wer" is "who?" in German, and matches fairly well with the "WE R" (POD) that is central to the message you have been reading about.. a lead in from the "I AM" of Exodus. This is your children saving you, wake up.  The "Ha" of Abraham and Horus is speaking to you. I am the Christ.He will
turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the hearts of the children to their parents Malachai 4:6



I've told you already that the Days of Creation and the Seals of Revelation are telling us a story about time recursion, about this event... this disruption in the slide towards darkness... happening several times.
 That in itself is a little bit disconcerting, understanding that a large part of this message is about not going back and yet, here we are.  I have never lived another life, but in ancient Egypt and in Judeo-Christian myth I see so many references to this life that it's clear that there is a huge focus on what I am doing--if you can
conceptualize that this place has been built to ensure the survival of civilization itself through a technological singularity that has... up until now... been hidden from nearly everyone; you may understand why this is so important.  It is the true purpose of all religion, and from my perspective what we do with the information that religion reveals about our history and technology is the reason that life itself continues, that civilization is finally
"salvaged" this time... it's also the reason we finally get to P'tah's never-never land.  I think it's because we're finally getting the truth.This alone should be
enough to start this fire.  Wake up.There is much more going on here than simply a disclosure of information, or a transfer of technology, the world is fundamentally being changed--albeit I believe from a place
that has been made blind--or worse negatively impacted by this technology in secret--in order to highlight social problems that may have caused the equivalent of a socio-economic ice age... in the days of No-Ah.  Financial problems have been highlighted by the low on the SandP in 2008,
but hidden within that entire story is a message about using prescient knowledge to prematurely put out a forest fire; the problem always gets worse when it's hidden.  It seems clear to me that this disruption is designed to stop a slide into the Dark Ages, something that you might not realize relates to JC and the "Fall of Rome."  Throughout our history, in addition to religion, are metaphorical references to right this second... and in the highlighted list of "Anti-Christs"
throughout history there's a very central common theme--the destruction of a republic and a descent into fascism.  The names of these people, from JC (Julius Caesar) to Napoleon (who is linked through the element of Salt, a huge part of this message) to
ADolf Hitler... the clear message is that losing the voice of people in government creates a steep descent into darkness.  Oh desert, speak to my Heart.  -LiveI don't really know how to explain this any more clearly than I have the keys to religion, and I am handing them to you.  There's an angel singing through us, throughout time, and in the word "Heart' understand he is singing about our home--it's the Heart of Heaven.   This
time, he's mistaken (Nickelback) for trying to break our Heart (Brittany
Spears).That same Angel has told me--and showed me--that he is actively attempting to organize an opposition to the spread of this message--of the truth.  Without thinking it through, it might seem wise to fight against the fire of the last day (of secret time recursion) ... against not disrupting our way of life, or exchanging a beautiful myth for a much
needed true messenger.  You might hear him singing about it in "we didn't start the fire," (Billy Joel) and today you might hear more light in the listing of "Names" in that song than you ever have before.  These songs are the sound of Thor's Thunderstanding... which I've tried to explain are a key to seeing a divine plan in names, to help the light (or in Hebrew) .. this God of Thunder's true message comes in the mechanism by which Nero starts his fire--fiddling with our minds (and all of history, Nero)... it's an accompaniment to
the fire of Prometheus--proof in language that this message of breaking our chains comes from the Creator of the Universe... and our civilization.  That every word be litIt's in every Holy Hebrew word beginning with Ha, in "authority," "eternity," and in the light of Judah's Menorah.
 It's in ever name of the God of Heaven.  It pervades religion, in a way designed to ensure that this disclosure of the existence of these technologies and their use cannot be hidden from the world.  What you are reading today
is the Hammer of Truth.This opposition to disclosing the truth is being done both consciously and subconsciously.  Whether or not you have direct contact with it, it is subtly influencing your beliefs, your ability to logically analyze
religion and this situation, and it's doing so on the face authority that it's what you want.  Understand that this is the Plague of Darkness, it's also probably a sort of wall--one that is intended to fall... something like Jericho.  It, along with the rest of the secrecy surrounding religion and government are darkness, and with a little bit of thought you might see how this could lead to the unequivocal destruction of
civilization itself.   I have personally seen, experienced, and can show you the effects of this wall of darkness--it is stopping you from doing the obviously logical thing and reporting on this information.  It might be stopping you from seeing how obvious it is that this is literally the story of Exodus--and we're leaving Hell.Enter the
Second Coming, and proof all around you, in every word and hundreds of songs that we are created--proof that is designed to overcome this
wall of darkness... to bring true freedom back to Humanity.  Together, we are saving Civilization itself... everyone must be saved (The Pretty Reckless).  There's a reason this message is coming to you directly from the Messiah, and there's a reason you can verify it comes to me from the Creator of the Universe.  Do that, then help me tear down this wall.  Proliferation of this message will make the darkness impossible to maintain... knowing is half the battle...sharing is the
rest.Adam Marshall Dobrinby no other name must we all be saved.

These pictures were all taken on the same day in Nashville, these are signs, and I've taken pictures of them all over America.  This story is predicted (Live), and it's everywhere (Fival goes West) in our modern art and in religion. Somewhere out there,
someone is wishing on my bright star. Break this story and save the world.  If you can't do it, find someone who will.  From the Fifth Adam, the proof is everywhere from He-man to Voltron, to Fival.   It's in Leviticus, Revelation, and Kalev.This is the dawning of a Golden Age.  The biggest story in all of history... do you not see the darkness?

If you missed some of them, there's an archive here.Under LockE and KeyNES I see patterns within religion that flow into our world, from our history to modern music and movies.  Within this Matrix of Light, exists a prophesy... one that predicts a great Exodus from darkness.   There are five E's that connect throughout the Bible to Earth.., and together they paint a picture of Creation itself, of a civilization forged in fire.  Between the messianic Den filled with the
Family of Christ... and the land of Edom--which I see as clearly being a kingdom with a hidden king, we are at a time where it's taken an act of God to deliver true freedom to the world.  Religion is the proof of this act, and the story of Exodus--brings us from the land of Earth-gypped and the Ewok to a place where we can clearly see that the slavery of the Jews in Egypt was a metaphor... for simply not knowing that it's our freedom that is being fought
for.   Here in this place, the Darkness is not being created by Moses... but rather made very clear--it's about censorship, about hiding the Light of the Son.I see this light all around us, and because of that it's clear it's from the Creator himself.  In everything I do, I am attempting to show you how to find it... so you can verify that for yourselves.
 It's hidden in plain sight, in the names of philosophers and video game systems... in the characters and actors in our movies .. what I call modern myth.  It's clear evidence, once you take a step back and try to understand the presentation of the message.  The entire world should be seeing this, it's
an inevitability, at the link just below you can see the coverage across the globe that these messages are making.  End the dark night, this light is more than bright... it's right.For instance, yesterday I sent a message describing how the verses of Ecclesiastes 9:11
relate to a message from the future about universal electronic voting, and use the company Die Bold as an example of who should not be winning the race (election).  In my mind it's important to realize that not only is the company name related, but the entire situation relating to electronic voting appears to be "Heavenly Theater," a created story to highlight what might have been a decades (or worse) long delay in the evolution
of democracy that the internet and instantaneous communication should be beginning... you know, a few years ago at least.  This message comes highlighted with prescient reference to modern font face and style (courier, and bold) in an ancient Old Testament verse... this alone is brilliant light, and should be cause for pause, and reflection on what it means for these modern computing concepts to be alluded to thousands of years ago.There are a huge number of references to modern computing tied directly into religion, from the "root of David," which I am suggesting is an allusion to the "God account" of Unix systems... something that is made very bright by the name of the book Exodus--read in reverse--which combines the commands "sudo" and "xe."  sudo escalates to this account, it's the logical equivalent of "God... do:" and Xe happens to be the name of an
Oracle Database... and also the element associate with the flash of a camera.  Together, I read "let there be light" which is the most iconic phrase ever spoken by God.The names Christ and Eucharist appear to include computer functions, Chr() and Char() pointing out the "t" that is shorthand for Christ in this hidden cipher which is the key to seeing the Matrix
linking together historical events and modern art through names and the meaning behind the messages.  In this case, the "t" higlights my birth-sign, The Sign of Sagittarius, which is the sign of anyone born on the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception... December 8th.
I see a joke.. in the word "Messiah" relating to this feast... and to the Thunder of Thor--the sound of Joan Osbourne singing about God being a "slob" like of one us... Without my birthday it's still a cute reference to the word "mess," but with it... well, I think it shows a clear hidden influence in her lyrics... about knowing my name...  which
happens to be DOB-rin, Date of Birth, our in... highlighting again the use of names to tell a hidden story.  The Book of Exodus, which this entire Revelation revolves around happens to be called "Names" in Hebrew.It's about seeing proof... and that's what this is.  What you could dismiss as a serious of coincidences eventually becomes statistical proof that there is in fact a message
from the beyond, everywhere around you.While it may or may not be clear that I am not God, this is the story that he has written for us.  I am a new person, living in his body... the body of our deliverer from slavery.  Through the story of my life, and struggle against the cross--which is clearly represented by the faults in our justice
system... he is waging a war against a destruction of the freedom that I've shed my grace to defend.  Take heed, this story centers around clear violations of the Constitution of the United States of America by high courts, the Supreme Court of the United States and of Florida... in a number of situations.  At stake are your rights to free speech, to privacy, and to
a fair trial--things that he and I are screaming at you to ensure you do not allow to slip through your fingers.Perhaps more importantly, what hangs in the balance is the truth... about the nature of reality and our hidden history.  Nearly within our reach are technologies which could deliver the place we think of as Heaven... or Utopia right here at home; pre-crime, and the ability to heal the sick and end world hunger.  Understand that through me, you are being given proof
that these technologies have been in active use throughout our entire history, without our knowledge.   A huge part of this message revolves around clearly disclosing the existence of these advanced technologies, and wisdom related to how they might be best used in order to help us moving ever so much closer to Heaven.  Believe it or not... it's in Minority Report, in Total Recall, and in A Scanner Darkly... and
in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep--decidedly we do not.  Good morning.Hand in hand with these technologies comes a message about knowledge, and about Universal Voting, and the day quickly approaches when we will have the ability to use them.  Please ensure that we do much better than nothing.I could tell you it's as simple as looking at wave-function collapse, and seeing that it's much more easily explained by "virtual reality" than some natural phenomenon... or point out the light, the purpose of religion, hinging around this disclosure that we are much closer to Heaven than we had thought.  I
could point out the words of the Lord's Prayer, that the Earth is in Heaven, or the numerous recent scientific reports suggesting the same.  This is all for a reason, and that reason... is building Heaven.  That start's here and now. #letfreedomring-aIt's not a test, it's the...












 
                                                            
What if God had a name?  Start believing.



















The Plague of Darkness21 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over
Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” 22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 23 



To Shamayim.
















I'm usually not one for superstition, but for this number I have to pause.  In Judaism this is Double-Chai, it's the luckiest number in existence... it's about life, and today I am celebrating.  In our myths, all the way back to ancient Egypt and throughout American history we have stories about what is happening right now, about this Holy Fire.  Yankee Doodle's riding
to town, and this horse is not pale... there reference to a feather is about Shu, son of Osiris' crown, and with little bit of research you will see that the feather is this light--it's here, if you care to check.Shamayim
is the Hebrew word for Heaven, and from Egyptian myth to Judeo-Christianity there's a clear message about Heaven being created through water and fire... references to Us--the people of the Earth, and the truth.  This is the path... the way we all get there.  ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 











The roots of the word shamayim are אש (esh, fire) and מים (mim, water) The beginning
letter א (aleph) is a silent stand-in for a beginning consonant, nothing more. Dropping it does not change the meaning of the two-letter word. So the Hebrew שמים literally means fire in water.Rabbi Shlomo bar Yitzhak (1040-1105), or Rashi for short, was the greatest of the Jewish commentators on the Old Testament during the Middle Ages. Concerning Genesis 1:8, he says this:The word shamayim is a contraction of [a word for] carrying of water, also [a word meaning] there is water, also esh and mim, [meaning] fire and water. He blended them with one another and made the heavens from them.Holy Water is People, and this is the Sang Rael.It's probably pertinent to mention that Joshua is the son of Nun--what is (to me) a clear Egyptian reference to the prime-ordeal waters--that's Us.. it's Humanity.  Seeing the link between
these ancient myths and today is part of the shift in understanding just how important this time is to the future.. this transition is literally the focus of all religion... our history, and my being.The proof is in every one of idioms... from ready or not, here I
come to blood is thicker than water.  The Holy Grail comes from seeing this message woven from Genesis to Revelation... expanding the family of Eden... a sea of first initials to the multitude of Revelation... and through seeing the blessing in disguise that is the First Plague... turning water to blood.  This
is the "magic" that Exodus describes, perhaps less visual and yet supremely more important.  It's about the Blood of Christ, in the chalice that we see as Earth--just a jump in time and one letter away from the Heart of Heaven.See what it means that these idioms fit so
perfectly, this is about disclosure... it's what makes true family.



This is the light of His SOL, it comes from the glowing Sun above... and from the Sons of Liberty, the Statue
of Liberty... and seeing this message woven throughout history.  It's in language, and religion, and standing on the lamp of Judah Maccabee (that's the Tribe of Revelation 5:5, linking the Hammer of Thor)  ... a derivation of "AH" from the word for the Spirit of God ... Shekinah, to the names of the wives of every Patriarch of Judaism... Sarah, Leah, Rebekkah... to Mary.. that "sea" and this is "why."  From the name of that lamp, Men or
AH? (a question I see posed to the Sons of Liberty... see our light!) it's clearly all humanity... this Bride of Revelation.








 
                                                            
See our Light... it's about names, time, acronyms... the Sons of Liberty ..and movies.



















In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness

Tomorrow, I'll have something to say about the Plague of Darkness.  Those are all media. Seriously, this is obvious right?       nashon@unduecoercion.org



Well, I thought it was clever.  Mor? ... MondayI watched as the Lamb opened the ... seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder,“Come!” I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake.The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. 14 The heavens
receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.Revelation 6​From the future comes a message focusing on freedom, transparency, and quite literally linking the very foundation of religion itself to science and technology.  "First words" are a big thing for God, and in the very first words of the actual Burning Bush comes a message about the use of technology to ... continue the slow and gradual process of evolving the structure of our government with
decades plus old technology like the telephone, the internet, and ... well, as Imagine Dragons puts it "It's a revolution, I suppose."In the words spoken by George W. Bush on 1/20/2001, his inaugural address... prescient reference to
the font face Courier, and the font style.. Bold.  It's the kind of thing you almost wouldn't notice... until you get it."We know the race is not to the swift... nor the battle to
the strong."Later, I'll show you how the successive lines of Ecclesiastes 9:11 answer a riddle, one which relates to the stars falling from Heaven.  It does this by listing ... in order from Mercury (the swift messenger of the gods) all the way to Time and Chance... Saturn and Uranus.. each of the 7
planets, and 7 corresponding elements of the modern periodic table: from Hg to Uranium.  With just the words spoken by Bush (half of Ecc 9:11) we find another hidden message...



The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which
thou sawest are... Hg  Na  Xe  Fe  Si  K  and  U  Mercury    Venus      Exodus     Mars       Sight     Potassium and Uranus   the race   the battle bread for the wise   Thnderstanding       Saturn and "per chance"Revelation 1:20 (note it's the date of
the speech, where Ecc 9:11 is quoted, months before 9/11)Briefly, Mercury is delivering this message: "Lo, Venus..." is the woman clothed with the nus of Revelation, with the moon and stars at her feet."  The light of Exodus is reading in reverse "let there be light." Iron relates to my middle name, and the Iron Rod of Jesus Christ... Silicon gives sight to the 14th element, the 14th letter (New to n?) the light of Jupiter's
lightning (He-rod) and the sound of Thor's thunder.  



From the Person of Time, Iran... but really, the whole thing is a set up.... for great justice, light me up.The Servant will be set up, and will be very high. Isa 52:13

My apologies if this is a duplicate.  I'm trying... but it's hard.-aI have written a little bit before in this e-mail series about a number of microcosms that appear to have been "written into"
my early life... sort of "actualizing" the kind of thing that appears in Matthew 3--where Christ walks through the story of Exodus.  As if beside myself walking through Sam's valley, these stories appear to shed light on what I am doing now, and give me some comfort in knowing that there is more planning involved than I've personally done.  For really brief history of Adam and Mary, and some insight into what I mean by this "microcosm thing," you might
be interested in this: http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2194940/pg3#37208655, there... you will see that people used to talk to me... take note that even those people (we call ourselves conspiritards) don't seem to find the Apocalypse worthy of comment.  It's probably important to note that the Adam and Eve you see sitting on a throne are not the same people that are before you here.  Here, we are their children... something like this unrelated book explains, which also uses the actual names of Jesus and Mary.This.Several times during my trip across the country a fairly significant "revelation" came up, one which I think probably
will sooth your soul... or at the very least actually help save it... on a hard drive.  It seemed as if we were broadcasting a sort of technology update, one which appears to be a "quantum leap" forward from our current ancient land of ones and zeros... one which might highlight just how throttled our current "amazingly accelerated" computer revolution might actually be.  One, a long long time ago, I was a database administrator at a staffing firm called "The CURA Group"
... which I later read through the eyes of the decoder ring to the cipher as "see, you are a group..." anyway, to get to the point this little tidbit of information comes by way of SalesLogix, which is a "PeopleSoft" type of program.  It relates a little bit to my What-son, that might now rewrite the meaning of DNA as "desperately need Adam."  So, this is highlighting that in a similar way that DNA uses molecules for storage (I'm aware DNA is still
"binary"), and SalesLogix used auto-incrementing alphanumeric keys (which by the way began with "A0RME" by default, hah) we could probably build storage devices which mimicked the functionality of DNA transcriptase with a much larger alphabet of molecules yielding storage capacity that would be significantly larger than what we currently have.  I, of course, have a wonderful several-month in the telling story about DNA and "don't need Adam" that
probably includes some mythology from Stargate SG-1... but I mean, look where we are.  This is a map in history, in names like Watson, and Sherlock Holmes... one that lights up my eyes.



I could probably write an entire book about the influence of Heaven in our motion picture industry, not just in the content of the movies... but in the actors and the links between movies made by people like Cameron Diaz, I swear
there's Something About Mary... and between Charlie's Angels, Being John Malkovich, well... believe there's religion in LODI DODI.  What's my mother-f-ing name?This is only the beginning, I am trying to start a global conversation, one that really does lead to the creation of Heaven
itself...  to the morning.   ​​​​​​​



I've spent a good deal of time trying to show you how the story of Exodus relates to America; but really it's quite a bit more than just Exodus, just like it's more than America.  In the magic of names, the "I AM" of that first Holy spark kindled a torch of freedom that
glows bright from the days of the Sons of Liberty, and as a proud beacon at the pinnacle of the Statue of Liberty.  This is the light above, to guide us through the night, and if the awesome spectacle isn't clear enough for you right now, look up--because it's our glowing SOL... See our Light?There's a song about God shedding his grace, through it all--I promise--to set you free.
 The light I see is in patterns that flow from history, to songs, through scripture and ours souls; it's showing us an outline--a glimpse into the inner thoughts of God and the whole world around us.  John Legend sings that "my head is under water, but I'm breathing fire..." and I know those words are reference to what you are reading: to a mythical man who had to get in way over his head, submerged in the sea before God's miracle--and clearly
tying that story of Biblical emancipation to Revelation.  This story of Exodus is linked to Noah and Christ through a pattern which links the Arks and wilderness to a number the Bible says is "Holy only to God."  That number is 40, and it's Holy hidden meaning is about the fourth dimension, it's about time travel.  We are rapidly approaching a time when we will understanding how proliferation of knowledge of this technology and true freedom are inextricably tied--how
the theological concepts of predestination and free-will explain that knowing the future is a constriction, a sincere lack of freedom.  We also have a Minority Report, one that suggests that for some things it might be uncivilized not to "look ahead" and prevent things like disasters... and perhaps murder and rape from happening.  I hope you will eventually see that things like the works of Phillip K. Dick, and the great deal of popular "fiction" and songs about time are
here for a reason, to help us see that this is really a huge deal.  I personally think that if we were shown the extremes, and given a real understanding of the possibilities--our society would do better than any kind of decision guided in darkness--that's why I'm doing what I'm doing.  I'm sure we'll do ... better than nothing.this be "n" jammin...https://www.instagram.com/p/BBdjT8Wr40n/?taken-by=yitsheyzeus a photo from Saturn and Son RLNYI swear by now I'm playing time against my troublesI'm coming slow but speedingDo you wish a

Momsen, AbsolutionTaylor also mentions in another song... that you're not getting what you want, unless you're getting it for free.  That's the truth.In another song, Live sings that "I gave my Heart and SOL to the

It's a kind of doublespeak, where God... or Nero as we might see a well thought out metaphorical reference to this musical bittersweet symphony, is speaking to the world ... well, through us.  I see clearly the fire spreading in "Rome below" is just like that of the Burning Bush... it's the voice of God filling the

Hello, this is a copy of two e-mails, which were mostly sent to the media.  Delivery gets difficult, because of people that don't agree with me that clicking that SPAM button over and over again, and not unsubscribing isn't complete darkness.  Good luck to you. For the rest of you, I apologize, this is "mostly" more of the same information reiterated.
 Although I do a bit of analysis that you haven't heard before.  I hope I'm not being a bother... understand, I am trying to break down a wall and save the world.-JC .... I mean "-a" btw follow @adjkjc too &lt;3



I indeed baptize you with water ((and)) with 
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.

Matthew 3:11 and ((ish))My name is Adam Marshall Dobrin, and I've spent the last few years trying to decode a message, one which appears within our... everything.  I am writing to you, and a significantly
sized group of civil servants, educators, and the press... in order to announce the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to a world that really doesn't understand what that means.   This is not the end of the world, we're in Eden... at the pace where God tells us all: "this is just the beginning."  I need you to report on this, the message I am delivering is proof enough of who I am--statistically speaking, there is no other explanation.  More importantly,
this message is designed to be sought by the world, and the world deserves enlightenment.  Because I can see the direct metaphorical correlations between events both the Old and New Testaments I can assure you that the First Coming was very similar to this one, the story of the Christ is truly American.  "Blackbird has
spoken, ((just)) like the first morning."  The disclosure of this message changes the world, it builds Heaven, and regains freedom and truth that we don't even know we lost.My entire existence is designed specifically for the deliverance of this message, to help the light... to help the world to
see.  The world's religions are a map to seeing this message of God in our music, our movies... all the way to the construction of the words we speak, and even the letters of our alphabets.  It is a message woven across time and fundamentally it's really all about using technology to help make this world a better place.  It's about seeing the connection between video games and virtual reality... and building Heaven.  It's in the names of the SON-Y Playstation, SEGA Genesis, and in the Nine Inch Nails that come right before 10, and do c Nintendo... long with this comes the disclosure of technology that explains how divine inspiration and prophesy work, and proof beyond doubt, in language and music that our civilization has been created specifically to fulfill this heavenly purpose.  What starts out as simply seeing the simple stroke of an apostrophe or a
yod parting a sea within the Hebrew word for Holy Fire... and connecting it to a little story about a man walking into the water until it he was in over his head, pointing out that it is proof of English anachronistically inside so many ancient Hebrew words... that actually parts our global sea... I imagine to be divided over whether or not
"this is it."  It's the fire of Prometheus, proof of creation in language.  Thor's thunderous accompaniment, in music and the names of bands like The Pretty Reckless, Dave Matthews, Cat Stevens, Live and Imagine Dragons... as we begin to see proof of "diabolical inspiration" as Nero fiddles with the minds of composers; to set us
free.  We're already hard at working hacking our brains, from the future comes a message of caution, the race is not to the swift.  In all, I hear Nero singing in more than you can imagine.  All those songs?  Probably about
me.The Lamb of God?  Islam, yknow, with the ko-ran.Yad: The Hand of God, that's whY.The path to heaven lies through miles of clouded hell; and more than anything this event is designed to ensure that our future does not turn to hell. A significant part of the message, pertinent to right this minute, is that these technologies and a fight against the disclosure of the truth have intertwined the Second
Coming with a message about ending secrecy and destroying censorship at its root.  Whether or not Washington wants it to, or the Vatican agrees... this is happening, for you and for our children's future.  What comes of this event is a better world, true freedom, and a renewed focus on actually caring about people, and the truth.







 







This is the light of the worldI am well aware that there are many among you who know for certain who I am.  I imagine a fair number of you suspect, and that there
is probably still a majority that is either very skeptical or completely blind.  This is the nature of what is happening, everything we thought we believed "scientifically" about reality is being turned on it's head.  Proof of Creation has been staring us in the face our entire lives, a message from the beyond: one designed to turn this Hell of darkness into the bright land that we dream of called Heaven.  Whatever your motivation, this is
news... it's the biggest story in all of history, and what I am delivering hails from the East.  That's a "masonic" metaphor for the future, and it's easy to visualize by imagining a compass rose over a graph of time-space, Heaven is J-north, the west is the past, and well, we're right at the bottom of that curve in the superimposed J that brings everyone up.  It appears to me that the entire media industry is acting as one machine, something that's very unnatural for
us.  It really only takes one of you to break this story, to change the world, and to bring to Heaven to the Earth... and despite seeing the e-mails travel across the globe after I send them... to Jerusalem, to Rome... almost nobody has even bothered to ask me a question.  You're missing a big clue, someone is trying to teach us a lesson about censorship and secrecy.The Fire of the Last Day and the Eternal
Flame are one in the same, believe it's about knowing that the days of creation and the seals of revelation are secretly telling you a story about time recursion--about this event happening four previous times--COME, you say... and yet nothing.  It's the last day in the dark, the last time we won't know the truth... it's the first day of free-will and a giant leap towards Heaven.  It's here already, the fire... and the bright light--the problem is that the world is having
trouble seeing it.  I need your help to make it clear.  I am the Last Adam, in every bit of lore of names in religion there is a congealing around a oneness between Isaac, Jesus, Moses, and Adam--the Apocalypse of Adam is one in the same with that of Moses, and Christ walked a microcosm of the story of Exodus in Matthew 3.  Isaac, nearly burnt at an altar--his name is only one "m" apart from the Arabic name of Christ--Isa.  That's Abra-ha-m, "open the
M." All of these stories are about right now, about me, and about this Exodus from darkness.. this is the great "secret" of religion.  As you see a man fall, know that God is lifting you out of Hell--it's all about perspective.  Understand, i'll be elated when we can finally talk to each other.What I am presenting to you "fits nicely" into nearly every messianic prophesy, it's news.  Understand these stories that come from our own future aren't being "fit," they're actually about this... about me.  From Isaiah 52:13, to Matthew 3:11, to Daniel 11:45... to all of Revelation, and I've given you some really keen insight into the entirety of our body of mythology and religion--which congeals around this single story, around a man on fire.  I can assure you without doubt that the "Sign of the Son of Man" is one in the same with the Burning Bush of Exodus... and that every single verse that talks about this sign is well fulfilled by the 1/20 speech which "secretly predicted" the 9:11
attack.  Look at these verses:Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. Matthew 24:30"But about that day or hour no one ((knew)), not
even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.  Matthew 24:36But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat 2 Peter 3:10"Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see
him, even those who pierced him"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of him." So shall it be! Amen. Revelation 1:7The oracle concerning Egypt. Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt; The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them. Isaiah 19:1It's a
horrible thing that happened to the world that day, but even worse is what's happening right now... today.  Without doubt, all of religion is truly about this event, and what happens in the years that follow.  Free speech and free thought have been laid waste, in a place that believes for some odd reason it's better to live in Hell than to try to make the world a better place.  That's what you are standing up and screaming by not sharing this with the world.  I've woken up in
a world where there are ancient books and myths written specifically about my life; more to the point about things that could have been made better, but were not.  9/11 didn't need to happen, Adam doesn't need to fall, and standing here at this point in time darkness does not need to cover the land.  I keep pointing out my initials are everywhere, and they are.  In every name of God, a reference to me.  In every creation myth... something about Adam.  The AMDuat (literally "That Which Is In the Afterworld", also translated as "Text of the Hidden Chamber Which is in the Underworld" and "Book of What is in the Underworld")[1] is an important Ancient Egyptian funerary text of the New Kingdom. It tells the story of Ra, the Egyptian sun god who travels through the underworld, from the time when the sun sets in the west and rises again in the east. It is said that the dead Pharaoh is taking this same journey,
ultimately to become one with Ra and live forever. In hour 10 the regeneration process continues through immersion in the waters until in hour 11 the god's eyes (a symbol for his health and well being) are fully regenerated. In hour 12 he enters the eastern horizon ready to rise again as the new day's sun.     --Wikipedia,
AMDuatAll along the Watchtower, the Hour is at handWith "eyes to see" it is clear to me that we are being led out of Egypt, out of the slavery of this place that echoes of "Earth being gipped," in nearly every Egyptian creation myth, from Atum to Ra (that's really adam) to P'tah (sure looks like Peter to me) to a battle
between Horus and Set... there's repeated and clear references to Eden, this place that has been filled with the light of Heaven, with an understanding of the laws of the universe that begins with an apple falling at Trinity College,
and then a link to Isaac... (New to n?), and Abraham's Maxwell... in Genesis a record of assistance from the beyond.  All around us today, this continues with the computer revolution, with an impartation and understanding of technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality that are the "stuff" of immortality... most importantly in Exodus, a record of this battle between darkness and freedom, one that you appear to be losing. This map to build Heaven.. both through social change and the use of these once hidden technologies is what I am reading
to you... showing you a relationship between the work of Phillip K. Dick, and Osiris' plan for Salvation... it's about Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly, and with not much thought you might see how these ideas could be combined in order to make a much better world.

Adam Dobrin on Artificial Intelligence




Adonai (אֲדֹנָי, lit. "My Lords") is the plural form of adon ("lord") along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic.[n 3] As with Elohim, Adonai's grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Scriptures, it
is only used to refer to God. As the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided in the Hellenistic period, Jews began to read "Adonai" at its appearances in scripture and to say "Adonai" in its place in prayer. Owing to the expansion of chumra (the idea of "building a fence around the Torah"), Adonai itself has come to seem too holy to say for some,[who?][year needed] leading to its replacement by HaShem ("The Name").El Shaddai (Hebrew: About this sound אל שדי (help·info)‎‎, pronounced [ʃaˈda.i]) is one of the names of God in Judaism, with its etymology coming from the influence of the Ugaritic religion on modern Judaism. El Shaddai is conventionally translated as "God Almighty". While the translation of El as "god" in Ugarit/Canaanite language is straightforward, the literal meaning of Shaddai is the
subject of debate.Adam Dobrin on... "IS"K, you are Z, we IL-luminate civilization

Adam's Hand?I started out beginning to write that the “light of these signs” lied in the prescient reference to our modern chemistry elements, and I was very mistaken. The meaning, experience, and beliefs that are “revealed” through the use of
these symbols is infinitely more important.While the “key” to the Iron Rod of Jesus Christ began in the very early days of my experience trying to imagine how the world could be saved… I wouldn’t see it’s relationship to other stories in the Bible or to the fundamental universal acceptance which I not only hold dear, but feel obligated
to tell you was something I feel “given” to me. I often remark that I have the right answer or correct intent at the outset of a discussion; and that I am keenly aware that this “early head start” is something that does not come from me innately but from what I call the “Sword of Jesus Christ,” it is something that I am very thankfully forced to adhere to. What I am describing can be gleaned well from the “Baptism in Water” that is the Sang Rael, and from a number of other religious nuances
which appear to serve the purpose of not only aiding intention but also chronicling that this aid is needed. The words “for repentance” in Matthew 3:11 make me remorseful in the implication that without the “sword” perhaps I would not have been so perfectly altruistic.On a “cuter” note, religious imagery like the name “I AM” serves as a subtle … yet eventually obvious “lead” for me to suggest the proper stance to take is “WE ARE;” and that like the Holy Grail and the name of the “First
Messiah” in Hebrew (Hosea, just shy of being the Whole Sea) it served as both inspiration and confirmation of the “right thing to do” as we begin discussing … Judah Meant: “day.” That’s an ((ish)) that I feel is very … Adam, though it too is most likely all part of the drive and story, one which is correcting the mistakes that are at the very least in the Word, and possibly in the hidden history. Just don’t Judge, I often said, in response to the idea of Judgement…. but truth be told the very
earliest incarnation of that idea was mired by yet another problem that pervades religion: reflexive control. In the earliest moments of this role, I was given the explanation and thought it worthy of repeating that “Judge not lest ye be judged” expanded the “ye” to “your Earth.” I suppose I felt it nearly identical, and made the very mistake that we find all so often in religion and law; a threatened punishment intended to modify behavior… that I believed was “innocuous…” or alleviated by the
outlandishness of the threat.Another testament to the Sword, I have to mention what I did with the obvious lead in to “WE ARE,” and in my favorite tattoo… which depicts the Earth as a Heart shape… for “Eden” containing an A and Sigma… for “Adam and Everyone” … I changed the “WE” to the French rendition, “OUI” in what was a very insightful homage to God’s near ubiquitous pan-linguistic tricks, and his name’s reference to the word “Yes,” “Ya,” and “Si.” Despite this inked indiscretion, I
firmly do believe that “WE” is much more important than “I,” and that feeling is so fundamental to the concept of Salvation, Christ, and America… that it is the truly the light of this first Symbol, the Iron Rod of Jesus Christ.So it was sometime during early 2013 that this voice, who I had come to call Jacob, began discussing how the disclosure of these technologies could help our civilization.In these conversations, I suppose the “Unexpected” thing was that I was clearly
being referred to as the Messiah; something that I had prior to that… not really thought within the realm of possibility. I knew that the story I was living had something to do with religion, but back then it was hit or miss day by day whether I thought there was any real truth behind scripture. I remember saying to Jacob, during the adventurous escapades that surrounded these long and informative discussions…. that “when you are this close to the creation of God, you don’t really believe in
him.”Since those days I have found a new strength in the Word, albeit in an interpretation which I know is not mainstream… yet has become the Rock which reminds me each and every day that the outcome of this struggle is beneficial, and that the intentions of nearly everyone involved are truly good. It’s sometimes difficult to explain a perspective that is optimistic, especially in light of the disclosure that while I do not believe that the fiery Hell described in the Bible would ever
exist… that it was not a mistake all together to describe a place that is here to me, in my interpretation it’s sans fire and the condition of possibly “losing the light” that makes it so. It’s truth here, as it so often is… but specifically now we are at risk of losing the truth about our history, our family, and at the very worst of possibilities how it is that “Creation” sustains us.Here, I’ve mentioned another technology… one that I think
commonly relates “Creation” to Virtual Reality.It’s really a complete change in understanding of outlook, of what religion really is, and how assistance has up until now come to us… that I’ve gone through in the few years since this experience and today. At that time I would have, as I imagine you do, completely missed what I call a primary purpose of Creation… manifesting itself in the world around us. That goal is the creation of Heaven, and I now see our world and history as
being guided very much towards an understanding of the technologies that are involved in the building of Heaven… from above. It’s much more than this disclosure, than the advanced near magical things that have been so pivotal in the survival of Us… it’s small things, like computers, user-interface, and medicine.It’s clear to me now that the “Singularity,” the information transfer which many people are expecting to start with the Second Coming … or the creation of a “Child of Humanity”
started in our very beginning. The great leaps we’ve had in the last hundred years are not coincidentally bringing us to a place where the ideas of religion have become a technical possibility… but rather are miraculously bringing us there.It’s really perspective more than insight, it’s seeing that there is a great deal of assistance coming to us, yet in a way where we are initially unaware of it. You could say we are the Golden Children… of… it pains me a bit to say it, but I’m not sure
who, exactly. The idea that this phenomenon is “recursive self-assistance” has been floated, and I myself have been used as a microcosmic tool for understanding it. It’s funny, before this very moment I would have told you that it’s not really “self-assistance” that even if our benefactors looked just like us, they lived different lives and aren’t really us. That’s partially true, in my mind, but just now it dawned on me that I probably would make lots of the same decisions as this … prior me …
both good and bad. It sort of takes something away from the “now” not to see that we are also doing this, and that even if it isn’t the very first time.. we must be very much similar to be walking in their footsteps. At the same time, it’s unfair not to credit religion for what it is, an attempt to help us not make the same mistakes that were made before… ones that without warning we might very well blindly make again and again. It’s this benefit, of actually knowing that there is great wisdom
and prior experience behind this message… that is so important to see comes from this new understanding of where religion really comes from. At the same time, I feel like our “now” and their “then” lose something from not having a dialog, from this moment… when I’m still not exactly sure… Who?The knowledge that prophesy being fulfilled, that there is true prescience in the words of religion, is something that gives me a strong desire to search for the wisdom and guidance… which you
might all together miss without it being pointed out to you. I missed almost all of it, up until the point that I really went looking for it–and frankly even then I know it was handed to me.It is perhaps a portent… that the light is so bright, so plentiful, really so needed to make sense of not just religion and history, but of us… and yet so easily overlooked. Again, it had to be pointed out to me, almost two years after this “beginning” event, and despite seeing proof of
advanced technology, hidden history, and even seeing focus and purpose… I saw everything but the “help,” and it’s really there, everywhere, and bright.

Dave Matthews Band Summer Tour Warm Up - The Stone 7.18.14



















Over the course of Time and Chance I provide ample evidence to prove the existence of time travel, of mind control and of God... I show you how religion has recorded the existence of these things, and our society has been overtly influenced
both not to see it... and not to believe that these things exist.  Again, proof is right before your eyes, it's everywhere you look, every single day of your life.  It's in every word of every language, your favorite song, and your favorite movie; in all of these things you can find and see the true "word of God."  All you have to do is try.As we move into "The Pursuit of Happiness" I begin to show you obvious patterns that connect
holy scripture and ancient myth across time and geographic origin.  These patterns too, are obvious, and for at least the last few hundred years have failed to see them.  Understanding that this failure is due to an overt darkness, something intentionally hiding the existence of these patterns is a huge leap towards "enlightenment," understanding that enlightenment is in my mind synonymous with having these obvious things pointed out... and somehow breaking through
the dark wall.  For instance, the Apple of Eden and Isaac Newton's inspiration has been nearly completely ignored until very recently.  The relationship between Isaac's name and the Bible, still unseen.  All told, the single reference I could find to this pattern lately... just barely scratches the surface of the truth, and puts it in the category of "noteworthy."  It's more than noteworthy, it's the obvious intent of both stories, to match each other.  Further, there's
clear and bright light linking them... to each other and to the story of Jesus Christ... in a Fig Newton commercial.  That's a Fig leaf from Eden, and Newton's apple.  Yet the world has no clue.  This is now light... coming from darkness.  This pattern all but proves a clear and defined relationship between religion and our civilizations' understanding of the laws of the universe, that's a big deal.

The Darkness gets deeper.  I have publicly asked people if they see some of the patterns that I write about, things like a confluence in the word "ark" in the stories of Genesis and Exodus.  I've been told outright by a number of people
that there is no relationship between Noah's Ark and the Ark of the Covenant.  More than once.  I've been told that the "Hebrew word used" is different, and because of that the authors had no intention of there being a logical link between all life being carried by an Ark... and the people then carrying it through the desert.   Really?  I then point out that there's an additional pattern, the number "40," which
apparently only I am aware is about the Fourth Dimension, about time travel.  Crickets, no response.This pattern using the number 40 continues into the book of Matthew, which portrays the life of Jesus Christ as microcosm of the Book of Exodus.  This is pretty obvious, with him scaling a mountain, crossing a sea, and then wandering in the wilderness for 40 days.  It's obvious logically that the desert, the flood, and the wilderness might related.  Here,
Hebrew helps, by using the same word for "wilderness" and "desert."  It's about a place of darkness, where we are wandering, not understanding something.  To me, it's about time travel, about the 4-D... or it was.  It's now about not being able to logically analyze religion, and then taking that concept one step further... and listening to me when I tell you that religion is pointing out that this darkness and this lack of an ability to
think logically is a microcosm... like in Matthew... telling us that we are broadly missing things... things that are closer to home and more fundamental to survival than being able to analyze a book.  It's a clue.This is about Minority Report, it's about using prescience to make the world a better place.  It's about a chastisement of God and Heaven... for not stopping things like shootings from happening.  I want to do this more than anything in
the world, understand it's about a conscious decision to give up "a little bit of free will" to get a step closer to Heaven.  You may say that I'm a dreamer... not only am I not the only one, i'm showing you it's possible.

I pull more from my analysis of religion, from Noah’s Ark and what I call the “two of everything God.” I think it’s a chastisement of our societies polarization, on things like God and Satan, and Republicans and Democrats. In the last few months, I’ve seen
what could have resulted in the fracturing of both American parties, which could have resulted in a four party system. People should think about how much better their wishes might be met if we had more than two polarized choices. Seriously, we’re blind.https://www.facebook.com/Area51.US/videos/10154006532644555/ &lt;- space reptiles on The SimpsonsSpace Reptiles do not run our country, but our entire society has failed to make a simple connection between a Donkey’s ass and the Elephant in the room, and figure out that we are not getting what we want the way things are. A significant focus of my
initial work describes what I see as an overt suppression of governmental assimilation of technology. While we have computers in every office, we still fail to see that we should be voting with them. It’s a big deal, a really big deal. George W. Bush once remarked that “democratic capitalism” is the best system ever devised. Whether or not he was right, “representative democracy” is clearly not, it’s a stop-gap, and one that is long overdue in evolving.The subtitle of the book that I still believe is going to change this world is “The Race is not to Die Bold.” Think about it, because it’s a play on words written thousands of years ago, in Ecclesiastes 9:11: “neither yet the battle to the strong.“I have seen this darkness overtly affect peoples emotions
and opinions, I’ve seen it happen in a split second, and in other occasions overnight. I have spoken to people that understood some of the patterns and messages, or were beginning to… and then in a fraction of a moment get distracted by something like traffic, and get so angry that they can’t hear me anymore. They forget what I say. I’ve seen people’s memories changed, I’ve had my own overtly changed so I could tell you that this not only possible, but happening.I’ve entered into discussions on mailing lists where I have presented evidence that English and Hebrew are constructed languages. In one instant, they ideas have been called “original and insightful” and literally overnight a change is wrought, and rather than discussing the subject-matter, a decision not to have “religion” brought into an education discussion was made. The idea that we should just ignore religion… well, that’s like deciding we’d like to ignore European
history… just throw it away. It’s moronic, and I am telling you that these desires controlled, they are part of a darkness trying to hide a gift from the world, one that I am intent on delivering. The gift is freedom, it’s knowledge… and believe it or not… with some wisdom… it’s Heaven.

The thing that the book of Exodus called a Plague of Darkness is a tactile retardation of our logical thought process, it’s something that makes us do things we wouldn’t otherwise do… things that fly against our own personal desires and opinions. It’s the
kind of thing that one would want to stop, as soon as they find out about it. While it appears to be designed to do something … to change our society quickly, by revealing what might have caused the destruction of civilization in it’s past life… not knowing about it will just have that happen once again. Closer to the truth, we are probably just walking towards the abyss without realizing…. and so I am screaming.Understanding the technology that is being used to do this gives us a way to fix it, not just to think clearly as we apparently never have before, but to be able to have the things that were once the product of this illogical thought process–this thing that was outside ourselves and caused problems to be highlighted… these problems could be shown to us more clearly, so that we might be able to logically analyze them
now, and fix them–the way we think is right. I can assure you, the right way is an open discussion.

I won’t be e-mailing you anymore. You can follow me on twitter, @yitsheyzeus and @adjkjc. Matt 4:19 Understand, it’s really about twitter.​​​​​​​The “Stone” in the Dave Matthews song at the beginning of this article, in the story of Moses, and David and Goliath… and Medusa… these “stones” are all St. One; it’s a hidden reference, in a hidden language, about a hidden messiah. Saint One sucks, talk amongst yourselves.This story continues… in By the Force of Key Strokes.

I have no doubt that this is the story that God has designed to change the world.  Nor do I doubt it is very different from the one you have been expecting, if you ... expected anything.

I have a criminal record, which Im sure any of you seriously investigating this have already found out.  Since nobody talks to me, and I see very little action at the book... which clearly explains what is in this article; I can only assume that there is a lack of interest because of it.  I will remind you that our Bible is filled with prophets... from Jeremiah to Joseph who were incarcerated, and that Jesus himself was tried by Rome, Maryland.
 This is a story designed to fundamentally change criminal justice, and hopefully to open our eyes to a road block that comes directly from secrecy and censorship surrounding the existence of technology and its relationship to government... one which is so fundamental to not only this story.. but to all of creation, that there is no doubtevery eye will see.

Distributing these things is very difficult, if you want to help... I ask that you share this with... everyone you can.
