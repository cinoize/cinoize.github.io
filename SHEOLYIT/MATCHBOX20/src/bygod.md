To me it's a clear statement that the promises of the Bible are bieng fulfilled, we can see it happening all around us--now right now--is the time to start participating more... and to understand that Heaven is much more than bricks and mortar--it's not&nbsp;<i>just</i>&nbsp;"virutal reality," and with the disruption that the "light of the world"--this message that God has written on&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;we have an opportunity to turn around a number of social and systemic patterns that would otherwise lead us towards a Hellish future.&nbsp; Nearly all of these problems revolve around the secrecy or misuse of technology, and this theme points me to the Constitution which has been changed a number of times improving social equality--but not once during the largest technological singuarlity in all of the history of the Unvierse... through the advent of phones, computers, and the internet... we have not properly addressed issues like privacy and public disclosure over and over.&nbsp;

Honestly on top of that never seeing anything "designed wrong on purpose" ever again should be another high priority.&nbsp; Our voting process is obvious "silly," twice now we have seen the outcome of an election fail the popular vote--and we aren't really talking about doing anything about that.&nbsp; That's a real problem, don't you think?&nbsp; A huge underlying theme of the "Light of the Burning Bush" is a focus on using computers to aid in creating a true democracy--not a "representative one" which you might remember Bush speaking about in the aftermath of 9/11.&nbsp;
