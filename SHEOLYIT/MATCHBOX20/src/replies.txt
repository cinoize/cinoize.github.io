?Thank you for contacting the Event & Conference Services office.  
 
This is a computer generated response to acknowledge receipt of your email.  A staff member will review your email and update you on the status of your request. 
 
If you are inquiring regarding space availability and/or requests, please see the information below to assist you. 


Check Room Availability:
You can check room availability for most event spaces on campus. This can be found on our website at www.drexel.edu/eventservices and following these steps:

* On the left side of the page, select "For Departments" or "For Student Organizations"
* On the next page select "Campus Reservation System" on the right side 
* Select "Browse for Space" to begin checking availability
* You can filter by date/time as needed.
* Gray and Blue blocks of time indicate when the space is not available. 
*White spaces show that you may request the location during that time, however this space may have a hold from another request. This does NOT confirm availability. 


Making a Room Reservation:
Reservations can be made by using the "General Reservation Request Form" under the "Forms" tab for either Departments or Student Organizations. Please be sure to include the account number to be used to confirm the reservation. Your request will not be processed until this is received.

Campus Reservation System (EMS Virtual Requests)
Reservations can also be made through the Campus Reservation System (EMS) for registered university student, staff, and faculty users.
Users will have access to submit requests for space, review real-time scheduling information, room configuration with corresponding capacities, as well as configuration diagrams to aid in locating the most appropriate event venue.    Additionally, users will be able to check the status of their request as well as review all previous submissions made through the system at any time.
User accounts will be granted to all workshop attendees. 
 
* Please note that entering a virtual request through our campus reservation system does not guarentee a reservation.

* You can filter by date/time as needed.
* Gray and Blue blocks of time indicate when the space is not available. 
*White spaces show that you may request the location during that time, however this space may have a hold from another request. This does NOT confirm availability. 


Making a Room Reservation:
Reservations can be made by using the "General Reservation Request Form" under the "Forms" tab for either Departments or Student Organizations. Please be sure to include the account number to be used to confirm the reservation. Your request will not be processed until this is received.

Campus Reservation System (EMS Virtual Requests)
Reservations can also be made through the Campus Reservation System (EMS) for registered university student, staff, and faculty users.
Users will have access to submit requests for space, review real-time scheduling information, room configuration with corresponding capacities, as well as configuration diagrams to aid in locating the most appropriate event venue.    Additionally, users will be able to check the status of their request as well as review all previous submissions made through the system at any time.
User accounts will be granted to all workshop attendees. 
 
* Please note that entering a virtual request through our campus reservation system does not guarentee a reservation.

?Hey there. Right now we’re answering another email or phone call about Drexel’s Residence Halls.  So while we haven’t seen your message yet, we will shortly.  You should expect a response within one business day.

As that’s probably not the reply to your message you had wished for, we have a few contingencies in place:

1.       Just click on residence hall options, to learn more about our halls and see 360 degree views of each room type.
2.       We thought maybe you’d want to learn more about Drexel's 2016-2017 College Learning Communities.
3.       Lastly, Drexel’s Residency Program is always an important topic of discuss at the dinner table.
 
Check out more information on our homepage.  It’s worth a visit!
 

We look forward to reading and replying to your message soon.

Events - Room Reservation
3:27 PM (0 minutes ago)

to me 
?
?Thank you for contacting the Event & Conference Services office.  
 
This is a computer generated response to acknowledge receipt of your email.  A staff member will review your email and update you on the status of your request. 
 
If you are inquiring regarding space availability and/or requests, please see the information below to assist you. 


Check Room Availability:
You can check room availability for most event spaces on campus. This can be found on our website at www.drexel.edu/eventservices and following these steps:

* On the left side of the page, select "For Departments" or "For Student Organizations"
* On the next page select "Campus Reservation System" on the right side 
* Select "Browse for Space" to begin checking availability
* You can filter by date/time as needed.
* Gray and Blue blocks of time indicate when the space is not available. 
*White spaces show that you may request the location during that time, however this space may have a hold from another request. This does NOT confirm availability. 


Making a Room Reservation:
Reservations can be made by using the "General Reservation Request Form" under the "Forms" tab for either Departments or Student Organizations. Please be sure to include the account number to be used to confirm the reservation. Your request will not be processed until this is received.

Campus Reservation System (EMS Virtual Requests)
Reservations can also be made through the Campus Reservation System (EMS) for registered university student, staff, and faculty users.
Users will have access to submit requests for space, review real-time scheduling information, room configuration with corresponding capacities, as well as configuration diagrams to aid in locating the most appropriate event venue.    Additionally, users will be able to check the status of their request as well as review all previous submissions made through the system at any time.
User accounts will be granted to all workshop attendees. 
 
* Please note that entering a virtual request through our campus reservation system does not guarentee a reservation.
