it's the purpose of the Prometheus myth, and of the Horus myth, the stories of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-11.htm" target="_blank">Adam</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-7.htm" target="_blank">Isaac</a> and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/20?lang=eng" target="_blank">Isaiah</a>... not to <i>mention Jesus Christ</i>.&nbsp; It's the reason there was an <b>earthquake on 3/11/11</b>; and a band named <b>311</b>... this "it," this <i>thing that you are so easily persuaded to overlook</i>, is overwhelming and resounding evidence that we are living in a "simulated reality," and that the Bible and our entire world contains a message from God--one that has been hidden in plain sight for your entire life.&nbsp; The forces behind this "greatest lie ever told" are both technological and social; there is a tool that is being misused, and we are apathetic, ignorant, and maybe scared to stand up for the ideals and beliefs that we were created with, that we know are right.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is all you see "the Total Eclipse of the Son?" because all I see is Hell everywhere I look.&nbsp; I see blindness, first through the hiding of clear and obvious patterns--things like "40 days and 40 nights" connecting to a message about time travel, and about a desert of understanding.&nbsp; People that refuse to even acknowledge that the "40" in Genesis and Exodus and Matthew has some kind of special meaning, that it was repeated on purpose; not even to get into discussing that it <i>definitely </i>means "4-D." &nbsp;Its about time, and very clear proof of anachronism in language that <i>could be</i> easily verified.</div><div><br /></div><div>Instead we stand here looking at the ground, refusing to see that <b>the fire </b>of Isaac and Matthew <b>3:11</b> are shining bright overhead, lighting huge problems in our social fabric; from an election system that has now two times failed to agree with the popular vote, <i>not to mention</i>&nbsp;a system that has failed to change at all in the hundreds of years that have given us the telephone, the internet, and cars--we still vote as if paper ballots need to be carried by the Pony Express. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The fire continues to glow over the most anticipated story in all of history, a tool being used to end censorship; and to show us just how malleable our minds and our social system really are--how weak we are in the dark. &nbsp;<i>I know free speech and "democracy" are important to you, I really do;</i>&nbsp;but there is so much more at stake here than these new inventions.&nbsp; This message proves that we are not in reality, connecting "quantum entanglement" to that shocking revelation, it becomes clear that this lie has now affected our science, our understanding of the universe... it has caused the greatest minds in physics to spin their wheels trying to do the impossible--to connect the laws of nature to a "hack" a computer shortcut... it is damaging "knowledge" not to know the truth, go figure.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Even more astounding, as we digg deeper, to find the lowest possible place we can hide under this pyramid; the shining message we have written with our own hands, guided for certain with the light from above... it tells us that correcting this same lie opens up new possibilities, new frontiers in medicine, and gives us the ability to much more easily solve the biggest and most pressing problems of our time; famine, hunger, disease, aging.&nbsp; All we have to do, to see Heaven built from this place... is to see why censorship is the biggest problem in the known universe, the destroyer of worlds, and the creator of Hell. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Silence is an unnatural response to "<b>pen is</b>" says the pen of God.&nbsp;

That's "game" backwards without the "e" and that same letter hidden in the natural log function that completes that name as almost meaning something like "it's not a game of words or a game of logic." &nbsp;Oops.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, moving on from word games, Ender spent some time on Card's vision of what our internet is, arguing with himself in order to sway the popular sentiment related to uh, well, I don't exactly remember; but the series is wonderful. &nbsp; Since none of you talk to me, I don't really have any questions to field, so if you were interested in researching anything about my background or what's happened to me before I get around to actually telling the story, you might be interested in these links.</div><div><br /></div><div><h1 class="m_-2984681577522601m_-5815431775586231050gmail-m_-7472913645823006934gmail-m_8872025244709890398m_-3626107903571621580gmail-firstHeading" id="m_-2984681577522601m_-5815431775586231050gmail-m_-7472913645823006934gmail-m_8872025244709890398m_-3626107903571621580gmail-firstHeading" lang="en" style="background-image: none;

So that word, "<b>fire</b>," it really does mean God.&nbsp; Today, I have a new word for you, a new word that means God to me, it's&nbsp;<b>Ha.</b>&nbsp; You might not see it yet, in the story of Abram and Isaac, searching for the lamb to sacrifice; it's an odd story, that's for sure.&nbsp; Seemingly unrelated, Abram later&nbsp;<i>made a deal</i>&nbsp;with God; and for that he had those two hallowed letters donated to his name, which you still probably don't know&nbsp;<i>really means</i>&nbsp;"<i>open the message.</i>" &nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div>Laughing about it, that's what Isaac means in English; that "ha" just the parted sea a throwback to an earlier time, or our time to be exact; a joke resonating over thousands of years; about a wood altar, about a burning desire, about a kid that just won't die.&nbsp; In my mind one of the stories of Jesus teaching the people ties directly to it; but there's a little jump, I don't you know that Jesus actually did mention Elisha, and another link through time connecting Spanish and English, you know, through "is" and seeing that Isaac's Ha is "the" in Hebrew, just like Adam's "El" is "the" in Spanish, and God... you know, in the hallowed halls of ancient religious myth.&nbsp; So that word, "<b>Ha,</b>" it really does mean God.</div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div>I've tossed around the word "<i>palabra</i>" as another possible candidate, but that word, it doesn't&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;mean God... or&nbsp;<i>maybe it does.</i></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><div>Brigham Young used to teach that&nbsp;<i>Adam is God</i>, I think they called it the "Adam is God doctrine," and while the LDS Church later stop teaching that, I'm fond of it... even though I'm not&nbsp;<i>really God...&nbsp;</i>or maybe I am.&nbsp; No, for certain if I were God we'd have seen a sign in the sky, a glowing ball of fire just isn't good enough for me, or for you.&nbsp; Words apparently are not good enough for you either, even every word being laced with a hidden message... that's not news in our world; this place that God wrote about in 1984, well; he wrote about it way earlier--but that's the year you know.&nbsp; All around, people everywhere have seen bits and pieces of this message;&nbsp;<i>this message from God.</i></div></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><a href="http://spockalypse.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://spockalypse.blogspot.co<wbr></wbr>m</a></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div class="gmail_quote"><div><div><div>The press has ignored it;

Scared to change the world is the best excuse I can come up with; but it's really not all that simple... there starving children dying every day for no reason, really no reason at all.&nbsp; There's plenty of people that can't walk, and can't see;
