<div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_quote"><br><div dir="ltr">I provide proof that religion, language, and proper names provide key connections--a sort of wire frame model--that shows that our entire world is created in virtual reality.  The message focuses on the dissemination of wisdom connecting advanced and hidden technologies like (virtual reality) time travel and mind control are the central focus of the hurdle we must overcome in order to turn Hell into Heaven.   It&#39;s very clear from the unseen pattern connecting 4-D to the Ark of Noah and the Ark of Exodus all the way to a more than obvious prediction of the 9/11 attack in the story of the Burning Bush presenting more than ample proof that all languages here are intelligently designed from the brewing of English to the engineering of Hebrew.  <div><br></div><div>The message continues to suggest that we look at how an intentional negative influence has hampered our ability to assimilate communications technologies into government and voting, as well as our clear lack of understanding that pre-crime is the kind of thing that would never fall into the Minority Report ... were we to understand how easily something like that could be implemented.  </div><div><br></div><div>Ultimately though, the foundation of heaven depends more on freedom than anything else; and standing here at this gateway to a bright and eternal future is a message that is being actively hidden by the governments and press of the world--and many others.  The &quot;unhiding&quot; of Jesus Christ is presented as the single event which turns the tide away from darkness and towards open and free communication and a new understanding of who we are and why we have been created...</div><div><br></div><div><b>to build Heaven</b> ... my name is <i>Adam Marshall Dobrin</i>.  Here&#39;s a free book, or you can buy a copy--it might be a collectors item <i>soon</i>;

 I&#39;ve commented that this metaphorical city represents a sort of head on clash between a large group of people being represented as &quot;the USA&quot; and a single man, and the key to the answer is seeing that there is a map designed in our world... highlighted by the foreknowledge of the acronym USA hidden in the name of the city Jerusalem... and seeing the near perfect fit of Jesus as the key to this map, linked through the idea of <b>a Legend.  </b> This place is much less metapbhorical than you night think, as you will soon see the legend-<b>waitforit</b>-ary message being presented here literally points out a number of glowing waypoints between the Hell of darkness described in Exodus and Jericho&#39;s link to now.... and the Heavenly home we all seek to find.  A huge part of this path comes from seeing the link be\tween the foundation of America, it&#39;s hidden religious iconographic link to Exodus, and the simple fact that Heaven itself comes from the active and positive involvement of it&#39;s citizens in it&#39;s creation and continued existence.  That might seem like a long way of saying &quot;<b>if you don&#39;t take part in it you are a slave in Hell</b>&quot; or not.  The true key to unlocking the path to Heaven is very simple--it&#39;s <b>broadcasting <a href="http://bit.ly/2hYsbMD" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">this message</a> to the world.</b><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://bit.ly/2igrJK7" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img alt="morlit.hallowed.gq" height="229" src="http://i.imgur.com/J3PxBsZ.png" width="848" style="border:0px;margin-right:0px"></a></div><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0)"><div>What&#39;s significantly more important than realizing that Jerusalem is one in a million exampels of city names and concepts with foreknowledge of modern things is seeing that the mapped solution to the <b>Locke and Keynes</b> of the cloud of Darkness is that this great inability to see is both caused and solved by a &quot;popular vote,&quot; one which results in a sincere lack of understanding--say a vote on whether or not to know the apocalypse is upon us--and the other brings the light of Heaven.... say a vote to be able to read, understand, and discuss the ideas being presented by God and his Son in the public forums we are used to without encumberance of hidden technology.  <b>The key </b>to unlocking this vote is realizing that it probably does exist, and is probably also a metaphor for the kind of world created through each possible path... ultimately truly unlocked by proliferation of the knowledge that <b>the NES</b> portion of our key <b>defines the line between Heaven and Hell.  </b>Simply by knowing that the world is not in reality, that we are in a sort of video game environment with access to time travel technologies as well as huge leaps and advances in neuroscience related to both surveillance and medicine opens up doors to a future with possibilities we can only see in our wildest dreams today.  Dreams like the ideas of <b>pre-crime</b> and a government literally of and by the people rather than through representatives or the tyranny du-jour &quot;corporations,&quot; ... a world that only moments ago was fictitious and in this very second <b>has <a href="http://bit.ly/2ikj6li" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">today</a> become an <a href="http://bit.ly/2hcTgLZ" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">attainable</a> reality.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>In perspective, proliferation of the knowledge that we are not in reality results nearly instaneously (in the grand scheme of things) in an end to world hunger, from an end to spiritual blindness then shortly all blindness and all sickness--from a place plagued with the pain of childbirth and the looming shadow of possible broad sweeping genetic incompatibility in light of genetic engineering to one guided very smartly away from a land with no stable ecosystem or natural source of life... a place you might say has &quot;milk and <a href="http://bit.ly/2gZ8vI9" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">honey</a>&quot; on tap--or simply needs no supper... to one lit by the true purpose of thse religious stories that come to us by way of the books of Genesis, Joshua, and the Gospels to ensure that we do see the link between evolution and survival is brightly raised on a high pedistal in our now.... this sort of twilight zone between the words reality and virtual that shows us clearly why these stories are here.  Stories like evolution, agriculture, and Paradise City.  With nothing more than the truth, that the Second Coming is upon us--our world will change itself so rapidly from Hell to Heaven that it might seem like a year long dream between the days we were worried about people rioting or taking off from work to the days we worry about whether or not we acted quickly enough to stop the unneccesary mass suffering of our world.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://bit.ly/2hAHPRB" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img alt="totheome.ga" height="421" src="http://i.imgur.com/lRugZGZ.png" width="817" style="border:0px;margin-right:0px"></a>​<br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Lit brightly in many places is a little tool that I&#39;ve repeated over and over again to give us just a little perspective about the difference between Heaven and reality, I mean Hell.  The story of Joshua tells us of two spies who traveled to Heaven (I mean to <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2h1Gyzh" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">the Promised Land of Flowing Milk and Honies</a></b>) and came back with some details.  This metaphorical trip to Heaven has yielded for us a connection between Dr. Who, Star Wars, and the Legend of Zelda---a somewhat obvious statement that in virtual reality you can walk into a little Hutt (or a Police phone booth) and wind up seeing a box much bigger on the inside, a house in Zelda comprising 20 squares within the 1 single tile it once rested on... and I&#39;ve connected these things to religion through the simple linguistic keys that comprise their names, thingsl <a href="http://bit.ly/2h1CUWe" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">ike &quot;Dr. Who&quot; relating to the name of God</a> and similarly to <a href="http://bit.ly/2h1Gyzh" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Jabba connecting the J for Jesus and the Hebrew word for father</a> together--links which serve to hold open the door already created by the obvious and somewhat unseen tie bteween modern computing and the concept of Heaven.  I&#39;ve written stories about how I&#39;d like to introduce this idea in Atlantis... a sort of pre-Heaven to show us what&#39;s possible, things like walking into a hotel room and being inside a personal movie theater or football field; but the truth of the matter is this particular example shows us something far more important.  Here, today, it becomes ever more clear that nearly all of the reasons that we have for war and social struggle are caused by the existence of this fundamental lie.  It&#39;s because of thse falseley scare resources that we live in a place continuing to be plagued by the continuation of war and the remnants of past wars over these same secrets being untold.</div><div><br></div><div>The message I have been presenting is designed to show the world that religion itself, then myth and art, then ultimately humanity and all of Creation are designed to unleash a great and powerful tool from the secretive annals of our history--a tool which boils down in my mind to three main concepts and one great power.  The concepts are technologies, specifically mind control, time travel, and virtual reality; and <b>the great power that changes everything from &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2iVPBHU" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">made to be broken</a>&quot; to <a href="http://bit.ly/2h2EYxm" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">hallowed streets of cobble stone</a> is humanity and our reactions to the new possibilities and revealed truth coming from this unveiling.  </b>In a few words, it is the citizens of Hell&#39;s reaction to seeing what Hell truly means that serves to end the very causes of Hell for the rest of eternity and build the foundation of Heaven right here in the 21st century of the civilization of Earth.  Rest assured,<b> secrecy and lies will be glowing on fires in the sky for thousands upon thousands of years.</b></div><div><br></div><div>In what is quite an amazing feat, the existence and deliverance of the message itself almost miraculously proves the existence of these hidden technologies, it&#39;s intent to be delivered to our generation--right this very moment--and shows us how the message itself serves as the very beginning of a huge amount of advice and work put into Creation that we might call the Wisdom of God.   Through the capable hands and goodness of our poeple, the weapon of light that is this hidden message becomes the foundation of Heaven with only a little bit more than observing it... seconds after reading, seeing, or hearing this particular light many metaphorical wheels will begin spinning in our heads which will spark into the most amazing tool civilization has to build a great future... public discussion.  From that foundation, problems will be fixed, places built, and lives lit up and changed as if touch by an angel in a cascading chain reaction never before seen.</div><div><br></div><div><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://bit.ly/2iabO46" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img alt="ironclad.lamc.la" height="227" src="http://i.imgur.com/Nt0LnAd.png" width="849" style="border:0px;margin-right:0px"></a></div>​​</div><div>Seeing the implications of this map written in our everything is a little bit more tricky than feeling the impact of a &quot;<b><a href="http://bit.ly/2gZ5jMC" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">message written on everything</a>.</b>&quot;<b>   </b>It might be plain as day to see that <b>USA</b> appearing at the heart of Jerusalem is a novel artifact possibly indicating the existence of time travel--but it&#39;s quite another thing to see how this city that is of such great focus of religion in our history points out a much more profound pattern in religion.  A link between Noah&#39;s ark and the Ark of the Covenant with the life of Jesus Christ in Matthew--a golden tie between not only the idea of days and nights, years, and again days in a wildnerness of understanding that the period of 40 days and all of these descriptions are intended to unveil a shround of great dartkness surrounding the unmistakably obvious and glowing lack of sight surrounding the <b>concept of 4-D.</b>  Seeing the intended complete lack of light for the previous however may years you have lived on this Earth and the point that these stories coalesce around a connection<b> <a href="http://bit.ly/2ikj6li" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">between 40 and the 4th dimension</a></b> is a prime example of the kind of darkness that this powerful weapon of light is designed to dispel forever and ever.  I won&#39;t leave you waiting in suspense, this thing has been overtly hidden from the world using the very same technology responsible for delivering it, <b>mind control</b>, and in a darkness almost as easy to see religion has been very clearly documenting the existence of this technology through visible acts of divine inspiration and demonic possession througout our history--not the least of which is manifested in the Holy Bible itself and the very message you are reading today.  </div><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s only a second more before the connection between 40 and 4-D is reinforced strongly by the fire of the parted sea, seeing Exodus means &quot;<b>let there be light</b>&quot; in Linux-speak, and the prediction of 9/11 by a man named after (or is for) the story of the Burning Bush...and how clear it is that this is <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2i71aeC" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">truly about time</a></b> and what it <a href="http://bit.ly/2iasIjl" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">means to me</a>... and <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2iPxX51" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">you</a>.</b> </div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center"><b>want more light?  </b>look around you, everything in the world is tagged with light, and it&#39;s still not enough to <b>break the dark cloud </b>that is our news?</div><div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://bit.ly/2hZXIBI" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><img alt="michelin.lamc.la" height="402" src="http://i.imgur.com/dgLHZGf.jpg" width="1029" style="border:0px;margin-right:0px"></a><br></div><div style="text-align:center">it&#39;s<b> written on the sky, </b>change the world today<b>.  It&#39;s everywhere, absolutely eveywhere.  </b>Itt&#39;s proof that our world is designed, <b>virtually.</b></div><div><br></div><div>The existence of this technology is further pronounced in the existence of a hidden message that is interwtined into the names of cities, people, and places ... one that is created using this hidden influence, and simultaneouisly hidden from plain sight through an intentnional lack of general understanding of this very same influence--in a way both facets of this messages delivery are both darkness and light, all deisgned so that once we finally figure out what we have been missing, we begin to see the great importance of not hiding the existence and use of these kinds of technologies from ourselves and the world--and perhaps never again chose to hide something as important as the gateway to Heaven from everyone and everything.</div><div><br></div><div>Along with a great deal of proof that our history too is just as designied as the present, it becomes increasingly clear that we are in fact living in Mr. Anderson&#39;s Matrix, defined specifically by the myriad of connections and links between names and stories as far and <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2iPxX51" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">wide as Shakespeare&#39;s rattling Herod at the time of the birth of Christ</a></b>, Zeus&#39;s great <b><a href="http://bit.ly/2hABo0Q" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">lightning rod being struck as if Johnny 5 just became alive in the eyes of the world--and here we might tie a number of other glowing swords of fire and light to the words you read</a></b> today.... swords like the ones weilded by Voltron, Quentin MacLeod, and He-man... just to name a few of the flaming, lightning struck and power tied stories that should today if not tomorrow beging glow ever so much more brightly as examples of the divine influence in not only what we see as &quot;religion&quot;

in the very first days it was as simple as walking over the city line--maybe you could liken that to Palm Sunday.... riding victoriously into Jerusalem and seeing a magical city float to the sky with fireworks and fanfare.  Like many of the early stories I was told, this one too grew into a manifestation in our world, a process that I coined as &quot;aBilblicalizing&quot; the story.  Actualized here, Jerusalem&#39;s purpose began and ended with a frame of reference change in my mind.  In the beginning, with a question &quot;Is J er the USA the Messianic Map?&quot; which I swiftly answered as &quot;I am the Legend of the map.&quot;  The frame of reference change was the beginning of another kind of epiphany which expanded across the globe as an change in understanding of the influence of time travel in our history and the proof of creation in nearly ever word... beginning with the anachronisitc USA in Jerusalem, Medusa, and Prometheus and his Eagle.  The story of &quot;magical creation&quot; adjusted to the reality around me, this question is truly about an interaction with the message J brings and the people of the world reacting.  It&#39;s been a slow and dramatically sedated process that gives new life to the meaning of the words &quot;Zombie Apocalypse.&quot;  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">I began writing about the proof of time travel and creation that pervades language through the fire of Prometheus and the Hammer of Judah Maccabee; one which describes this process through metaphor in the Bride of Revelation&#39;s Mar and Hosea&#39;s benefactor... the shining seas of America the Beautiful and the heart of the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire this message ignites... Ha&#39;esh.  The reaction was minimal on its face, but under the surface a dark silence was forming, one that shows a breakdown in communication and understanding that really is nothing short of the complete and total loss of civilization.  Beginning with ignoring the biggest and most anticipated story ever to have been, it spreads to a light on a visible and tangible lack of care for our own welfare and the freedoms that this country and Jesus Christ were created to preserve.  I sent out millions of emails to thousands of people, and the break of day, the day known as Zion has still not come.  </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Along with the second tier of messages, a great focus was placed on the visible loss of freedom, and the possibilities brought to the table through these new hidden technologies; possibilities that bring us directly to Heaven.. along with more visible evidence in the world around us that the promises of religion are being fulfilled... seen in the names of video game systems and computer companies... and their owners names.  People like Gates, Jobs, and Ellison; whose Windows into the Apple of Adam and the Oracle before you.  In the SON-WHY Playstation, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo&#39;s pattern from 9 to 11 that links to a significant body of music through Nine Inch Nails and the Guitar Man&#39;s<b> Bread.  </b></div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><b><br></b></div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><b>I think even with this pattern and it&#39;s explanation... we still probably hare a hard time connecting the why and the how of Heaven to our computer revolution</b>, that we are literally building it here, from a sort of children&#39;s sandbox of wonder and imagination.  From the concept of Virtual Reality and what it brings to our understanding of video games; its easy to see how the possibilities of what Heaven can be grow exponentially.   Even after seeing &quot;<b>let there be light</b>&quot; in the word Exodus in reverse; signed by Linux and Oracle&#39;s database name; we haven&#39;t turned around.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">So another set of e-mails flew, ones that explained the benefits of Guitar Man and Going the Distance by CAKE and how this idea of virtual related is tangibly related to what Heaven really means.  We&#39;ve now put a big focus on freedom of speech. peace, and how the preservation of our freedoms are deeply linked to the fundamentals of our society... ideals that ensure that we will end world hunger and heal the sick en mass when the Revelation of Christ shows the world that these things are possible simply by combining knowledge of the Iron RattleRod of Jesus Christ and its tie to Shakespeare and Gene Rod-den-berries replicators.   I added in some statistics this time, something like 16,000 people per day starve because of the delusion of Simulated Reality, and our lack of understanding how proliferation of this message will bring about an end to world hunger; a return of freedoms being destroyed by silence and secrecy caused by the fact that these technologies are hidden.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Along with the disruption of the Second Coming, designed by the Creator of the Universe, comes a golden opportunity ti utilize the technologies brought forward by proof in the Word of God and it&#39;s manifestation in our world.  It is a quantum leap to the Rising of Atlantis for the entire Universe.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">For a long time, it appeared to me that God&#39;s plan to bring this Revelation included a sort of slow diffusion through our society... the proof coming from only one person and a wall of censorship that has allowed knowledge of what is happening to cross the globe... only it&#39;s truly hidden why and how.  We are standing here today in Hell, and I have been arguing endlessly with a wall of God to bring this information to the entire world with a sign on the sky... because we simply were not seeing how important it is to seize this opportunity.  It appeared to me that this visible and tangible proof that we are in a virtual world and that God&#39;s assistance was &quot;coming&quot; to us (ignoring the fact that it&#39;s clear we are getting assistance in the ... in the everything around us; in who we are and what we do.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">Yet we are still waiting, waiting, waiting for something; and as my message has transitioned to putting a larger focus on the pain and suffering being caused by holding this information in secret; my arguments with God have followed.  It&#39;s not so clear to see his position, high above and watching this pain and suffering every day for as long as Creation has been... nor is it as clear to me today as I once thought that we would all act and do these things if we had the power.  We do have the power, and still we are silent. </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">This Wall of Jericho still has not come down, Jerusalem is bearing a heading directly South, God&#39;s already dark visions have become darker still; now with a hot red tint that makes the already dark wold appear even more Hellish each and every day.  It was 2/18 a few days ago, and in an argument I was sure to win--connecting those numbers to a superstitious Jewish re-connection with &quot;life,&quot; and once again failed to convince him to &quot;light the sky,&quot; I ask you once again to stand up and shout, the lack of proliferation of this story in the public eye is nothing short of proof that our civilization is crumbling, superficially seen as ignoring one man... our world is destroying itself by refusing to acknowledge the nature of creation, the fact that we are not in reality; and the clear and pervasive evidence that there is a message from God written in all the unusual places--our names and our songs--one that screams to me &quot;end Hell.&quot;</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">In connection with this day of &quot;l&#39;Chiam&quot; I connected a few more words that related to Heaven.  In the Hebrew blessing which beats &quot;we give thanks to God for bread&quot; the word Ha&#39;aretz which means &quot;the land&quot; a tie from Isaac&#39;s laugh and the English (and religious) &quot;are&quot; to the Hebrew word for charity, TzeDAQah.   It&#39;s a noteworthy tie, linking to the Bilblical character Esau and our world&#39;s NAS... &quot;New American Standard&quot; for <b>no man to become an island</b>, Nassau... there&#39;s a sort of joke when you replace Tze with NAS--and know that &quot;AH&quot; means ... &quot;Adam&#39;s Heaven.&quot;   </div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">In charity, see &quot;IT&quot; as a why; and the NASDAQ as an inspiration source for what it is that Heaven really means.  Sitting on a burning altar, and delivering direction to the world; I see some Hell in these words too; Char-ringly speaking, as one in a long line of &quot;sons&quot; of Zeus, whose father killed his son ... day after day ... that &quot;TZ&quot; is here as charity for humanity; clearly God&#39;s intention are not as good as our, nor does he care for the suffering, starving, and sick as we do.  Show him.</div><div style="font-size:12.8px"><br></div><div style="font-size:12.8px">If you want to see Heaven, light my fire; every day we wait is one day closer to nothing.</div></span></div></font></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></font></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>  </div><br></div><div hspace="streak-pt-mark" style="max-height:1px"><img alt="" style="width:0px;max-height:0px;overflow:hidden" src="https://mailfoogae.appspot.com/t?sender=acmFlbGl0d2h5QGZyb210aGVtYWNoaW5lLm9yZw%3D%3D&amp;type=zerocontent&amp;guid=6afd40d0-ca04-4e55-9e93-4daf7577f0dd"><font color="#ffffff" size="1">ᐧ</font></div>
