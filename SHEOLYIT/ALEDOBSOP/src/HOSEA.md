You make it so difficult to talk to you, every day I look around and see a "normal world" a society that appears to care and love the same things that I do--freedom and fun and being entertained and entertaining, and here we are now I've turned "come and save us" into sea that saving the cheerleader is what starts the process of saving the world.&nbsp; I know you are good people inside, but when I come to you with a tool designed to "test sentience" to seek out conscious life that cares about the truth and making the world a better place you seem to balk.&nbsp; You sit in silence, and through your mouth and behind your eyes a monster appears from out of the deep of the sea and say a few "one liners" that show me very clearly it is the face of Medusa that I see---and that it's simply not capable of speaking intelligently.&nbsp; It shows me a problem, that you've apparently "come together one more time" to halt the changing of the seasons, and in doing so you've surfaced a problem for not just me but you also to see; a problem that comes lined with a solution.&nbsp; We can all see now that we are not in reality, we can see that there is a force here behind creation and behind us that shows us very clearly that it is "<strong>reasonabde</strong>" to expect that miracles can happen. &nbsp; In&nbsp;<strong>similitude</strong>, we are staring at a roadblock to conversation and communication that is fixed very simply, with the deliverance of freedom that is required for life to continue.&nbsp; Christina Aguilera sings that "baby there's a price to pay" and that price in my mind is seeing that this religion and this technology are here intentionally exposing how their influence here is a metaphor and a shining example of darkness and slavery, and that in order to be free of it we must see it.&nbsp; The price of freedom is written on the wall, it is acknowledging that here in this place what appears to be our own actions and desires have taken that freedom from us.</div>

Medusa and I get a kick out of seeing this hidden message in our language map our way to the future, and I've often explained that a number of these words are "time maps" from the beginning and end of&nbsp;<strong>eternady</strong>, showing us in bright light that between "et tu brute" and Mr. Anderson and Rock n' roll... the answer&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>&nbsp;is in language and, and,&nbsp;<strong>ad</strong>&nbsp;and... I am delivering it.&nbsp; This place, our planet and our lives are a weapon against darkness--a civilization filled with goodness and light to help guide the way, and we are here doing it another time.&nbsp; In the works "dark, darker, and darkest" be sure that we are at the third segment of a trinity that shines clearly in&nbsp;<strong>Abraha</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo</strong>... and see that the map in words is telling us something about when we are that is not immediately clear from&nbsp;<strong>Poseidon's</strong>&nbsp;cry.&nbsp; Look at Nintendo, that's Nine Inch Nails,&nbsp;<strong>tenebris</strong>, and smile for the camera--<strong>Pose, I do</strong>&nbsp;"save the universe" before&nbsp;<strong>n</strong>. &nbsp;<a href="http://uni.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Taylor</a>&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://youandi.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">might see</span></a></strong>&nbsp;it in&nbsp;<a href="http://os.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Os</a>c<a href="http://day.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">e</a><strong>ola</strong>, where I just left, and in this "evil spell" of everyone see "Al" that is the word "special" understand that every day is a new day, and&nbsp;<em>I am not trying&nbsp;</em>to "be daddy" I know as well as you do in my heart...</div>

This same map that links the "<strong>do</strong>" at the end to the "<strong>n</strong>" at the beginning shines through other names, like&nbsp;<a href="http://day.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Geraldo</strong>&nbsp;Rivera where you might see "Cerberus" or "MAX"</a>&nbsp;shine through. &nbsp; Understand it is the gaze of Medusa that&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://uni.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">turns me to stone</a>,&nbsp;</strong>that shows me light shining through NORAD and Newton and proves without doubt that at the work "darkest" we can see&nbsp;<strong>k is finally t</strong>.&nbsp; You'll probably understand there's some finagling going on behind the scenes to make&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyadam.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">a single person</a>&nbsp;the single point in time that turns the dark to light; but here we are and I am that. &nbsp; Every day when Medusa appears it reminds me that something is keeping you from caring about yourselves and about our society, and that shines through even when her stony face is not around, in your lack of action--in the rock of Eden that hides not only me, but the story that I bring that revolutionizes medicine, and computing, and truly is the gate to Heaven when you realize that what is truly being hidden from the world is knowledge that we are living in virtual reality. &nbsp;<em>Not hiding me and that from the world is a good starting point to "saving the Universe" from darkness.</em></div>

So now I'm moving&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://os.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">on to original sin</a></strong>, so if you would be so kind as to mosey your way on over to&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://dick.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">dick.reallyhim.com</a></span>&nbsp;you will see exactly what it is that I believe is the original sin.&nbsp; It's some combination of "<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">no comment</span>" and a glowing orange sign over the comment box, keeping you from commenting.&nbsp; Now I can talking about "os" a little more, this thing that words and Gods tell us clearly is the end of death--the literal&nbsp;<strong>end of Thanat<span style="font-family: arial black, sans-serif;">os</span></strong>.&nbsp; I wonder if I have a victory here, at "os" is obvious solution, and simulating death is "<strong>sick</strong>." &nbsp;More to the point <b>Thanatos</b> is bringing to the world a message that gets found somewhere between the "act of civilization" and seeing that there is not one among us that would not undo a murder or a fatal car accident if we could--and that the&nbsp;<em>sickness</em>&nbsp;is a Universe pretending to be "reality" that is allowing these things to happen, and even worse, as we move through the story intentionally causing them.&nbsp; In our own hands, the sickness is manifest in a denial of an obvious truth and a lack of realizing that the public discussion of these things is the way to solve them, and that at the same time we are seeing how Medusa is lighting the problems of civilization, things like censorship and hidden control.&nbsp; Sickness is not being able to talk about it--or not wanting to--or not seeing that those two things are the functional equivalent in the world of "light" and "understanding control" that I am trying to bring you into.</div>

Less verbosely spoken, but really way more obvious, is that seeing "<span style="font-family: arial black, sans-serif;">God's dick</span>" signing the Declaration of Independence, and the Watergate scandal with both "<a href="http://reck.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Deepthroat</a>" and a Tricky Dick is a statement connecting Samael to the foundation of not just "America" but American values.&nbsp; You are blind not to see it, and <b>even worse; embodying the kind of tyranny and censorship that it stands as a testament against by hiding it. &nbsp;</b>Says the guy who didn't put it there, and knows it's there because you think "fake normal" is more important than "actual freedom." &nbsp;You are "experiencing" the thing that protects freedom and ensures that our society and our children and their children's children to not lose it, to ensure that what you refuse to see you are doing here and now will never happen again.&nbsp;</div>

This message, this New Jerusalem is woven into my life and the stories of religion and shows me that our justice system is not just sick, but compromised by this same outside force; and that in light of what we could be doing, were we all aware of it, there's no doubt Minority Report and pre-crime would be a successful partial solution.&nbsp; Thanatos brings too in his hand, a message that this same force is using our hands to slow down the development of democracy, and to keep us from seeing that "bread is life" is a message from God about understanding that this disclosure is the equivalent of "ending world hunger" just as soon as you too are talking about how to do it.</div>

<span style="font-size: xx-small;">However, Czechs do understand clearly at least half of the term -&nbsp;<em>pokus</em>&nbsp;means "attempt" or "experiment" in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Czech language">Czech</a>. It is rumoured there that the wording belongs to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>&nbsp;kitchen and court of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>&nbsp;(1552 – 1612). Also,&nbsp;<em>hocus</em>&nbsp;may mean "to cheat" in Latin or a distorted form of the word&nbsp;<em>hoc</em>, "this". Combination of the two words may give a sense, especially both meanings together "this attempt/experiment" and "cheated attempt/experiment".<sup class="m_158975033028017888gmail-m_-8331878344170685664gmail-m_5764344300076887091gmail-m_-4833942028542663904gmail-m_-8252426390011619265gmail-noprint m_158975033028017888gmail-m_-8331878344170685664gmail-m_5764344300076887091gmail-m_-4833942028542663904gmail-m_-8252426390011619265gmail-Inline-Template m_158975033028017888gmail-m_-8331878344170685664gmail-m_5764344300076887091gmail-m_-4833942028542663904gmail-m_-8252426390011619265gmail-Template-Fact">[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<span style="font-size: xx-small;">The commonly understood&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Principle of bivalence">opposite</a>&nbsp;of truth is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsity" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Falsity">falsehood</a>, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning.

Many human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most (but not all) of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Science">sciences</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Law">law</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Journalism">journalism</a>, and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. Commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Language">language</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Thought">thought</a>&nbsp;to an independent&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Reality">reality</a>, in what is sometimes called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Correspondence theory of truth">correspondence theory of truth</a>.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Lothario</strong>&nbsp;is a male given name which came to suggest an unscrupulous seducer of women in&nbsp;<em>The Impertinent Curious Man</em>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Story within a story">metastory</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a></em>.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: xx-small;">For no particular reason, Anselmo decides to test the fidelity of his wife, Camilla, and asks his friend, Lothario, to seduce her. Thinking that to be madness, Lothario reluctantly agrees, and soon reports to Anselmo that Camilla is a faithful wife. Anselmo learns that Lothario has lied and attempted no seduction. He makes Lothario promise to try for real and leaves town to make this easier. Lothario tries and Camilla writes letters to her husband telling him and asking him to return; Anselmo makes no reply and does not return. Lothario actually falls in love and Camilla eventually reciprocates and their affair continues once Anselmo returns.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: xx-small;">One day, Lothario sees a man leaving Camilla's house and jealously presumes she has found another lover. He tells Anselmo he has at last been successful and arranges a time and place for Anselmo to see the seduction. Before this rendezvous, Lothario learns that the man was actually the lover of Camilla's maid. He and Camilla contrive to deceive Anselmo further: when Anselmo watches them, she refuses Lothario, protests her love for her husband, and stabs herself lightly in the breast. With Anselmo reassured of her fidelity, the affair restarts with him none the wiser.</span><br />

I should be clear that I'm not blaming Nanna, or Mary; but the actual reason for the name "Wymar" and that's because she, like Taylor, acted as a microcosm for a sea (or more than one,&nbsp;<a href="http://sob.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Mom</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://sen.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">sen</a>) that was quite literally possessing her.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">sort of difficult for me to ex</a>pl<a href="http://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">ain&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">eve</a>n what that looks like</em>&nbsp;let alone what it feels like; but my observations tell me that she/you are not unhappy about the interaction, one which appears very foreign to me.&nbsp; Of course, the "eye" that I write with and the same kind of "inspiration" that you can see in the lyrics and skill of many musicians are also examples of this same kind of interaction.&nbsp; For example, Red Hot Chili Peppers sings a song called "Other Side" that explains or discusses the thing I&nbsp;<a href="http://medusa.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">see as Medusa</a>&nbsp;in the words "living in a graveyard where I married a sea" which also does a good job of connecting to the name Mary.&nbsp; &nbsp;As strange as might sound to think a group of people would be speaking through a single person... we are staring at "how it is" that&nbsp;<a href="http://medusa.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">could be possible, and possibly at exactly how it happened.</a>&nbsp; Normally I would have said it was obvious, but to need to actually say that becoming a single mind would be a serious loss for our society--well, that's telling.&nbsp; You might&nbsp;<a href="http://medusa.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">think it's silly</a>, but I'm&nbsp;<a href="http://hadragonbreath.blogspot.com/2017/10/humanity-is-trying-late-evening-run.html" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">telling you I see</a>&nbsp;it happening, I see it--and you see it in&nbsp;<em>the Silence</em>&nbsp;and the message.</div>

Still, it appears to me as if this "marriage" that I see described in our Matrix in the question "min or i" seems to be doing nothing more than keeping us all from discussing or acting on this information--something that certainly isn't in our best interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

So here we are, staring at a map all over the ground and all around us with the primary destination of "building Heaven" through mind uploading, virtual reality, and judging by the pace of things we'd probably have all of that good and ready in about three generations.&nbsp; The map has a little "<a href="http://legend.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">legend</a>" with a message suggesting that those things have already been done and we are&nbsp;<em>in the M<a href="http://rix.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">atrix</a></em>&nbsp;already; and it appears that the world, I&nbsp;<a href="http://hadragonbreath.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-last-question-roacl.html" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">mean Medusa</a>, is deciding we should put off seeing the legend at least until the next generation.&nbsp; I see how that makes sense for you.&nbsp; That's sarcasm, this is why I keep telling you that you are&nbsp;<strong>cupid</strong>.</div>

It is a big deal, and there's a significant amount of work involved in merging an entire civilization with "virtual reality" and you might see why he calls it a hard road--at least in the word "ha'rd."&nbsp; Honestly though, it's the kind of thing that I am pretty sure the future will not only be happy that we did, but they'd thank us for putting in the effort of adapting to things like "<a href="http://don.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">unlimited</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">food</a>" and "<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">longevity</a>" increased by orders of magnitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

That's not sarcasm, these things are actually difficult to guess how exactly we'll go about doing them; they are a huge deal--all I can tell you is that not "talking about it at all" is probably not going to get us there any faster.&nbsp; Point in fact, what it might do is give a "yet to be born" generation the privilege of being the actual "generations of Perez."&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

So, back to what is actually standing between "everyone having their own Holodeck in the sky" and you today; it is the idea that this message is not from God.&nbsp; More to the point it is the apparently broad sweeping opinion that hiding it is a "good thing" and through that&nbsp;<a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">a global failure to address the hidden interaction and influence</a>&nbsp;acting on our minds&nbsp;<strong>used to make this map--and also to hide it</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;With some insight, and some urging; you might see how&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">the sacredness of our consciousness&nbsp;<em>is our souls</em></a>&nbsp;is something that is more fundamental than "what kind of tools we have in the Holodeck to magically build things" and how and why the foundation of Heaven is truly "freedom itself" and how it comes from&nbsp;<em>right this very moment</em>&nbsp;for the first time, ever.&nbsp; Continuing to treat this influence as "schizophrenia" is literally the heart of why this map appears to be that--to show us how important it is to acknowledge the truth, and to fight for the preservation of goodness and logic over secrecy and darkness.</div>

With a clearer head and grasp of the "big picture" you might see how all of these things, connected to the Plagues of Exodus revolve around the disclosure that this technology exists and the visibility of this message showing us how we might use it for our benefit rather than not knowing about it.&nbsp; At the foot of Jericho, it is nothing short of "sanity" and "free thought" that hang in the balance.&nbsp; Clear to me is that the Second Coming, seeing "<a href="http://name.lamc.la/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">my name</a>" on television is a good litmus test for the dividing line between light and darkness, heaven and hell.</div>

The point is the truth really does change everything for the better; once we start... you know, acting on it.</div>

These particular apple and honey happen to tie Eden to the related stories of Exodus and Passover; connecting Eden to Egypt forevermore.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do see "Lenore," it is not for no reason at all; but to help deliver truth and freedom to the entirety of Creation; beginning here,&nbsp;<em>in&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2ibJn2b">Eden</a>.</em></div>

On a high level, I tell myself every morning that 'its not really me."&nbsp; It's not me that the world hates, or me that the world is rejecting.&nbsp; I believe that, I really do; I see that what is being hidden here is so much bigger than any single person could ever be--what is being hidden is the "nature of reality" and a fairly obvious truth that flies in the face of what we've learned our whole lives about history and "the way things are."&nbsp; Those few early details lead me to the initial conclusion that what is working behind the scenes here is nefarious, hiding a message that would without doubt shake things up and change the world--and nearly across the board in ways that I see as "better" for nearly everyone.&nbsp; It's a message at it's most basic level designed to advocate for using this disruption in "nor<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">mal</a>cy" to&nbsp;<a href="http://bygod.whenistheapocalypse.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">help us</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">revolutionize democracy</a>, to fix a&nbsp;<a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">broken mental health</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">criminal justice system</a>--just to name the few largest of the social constructs targeted for "rejuvenation."&nbsp; On that word the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://sob.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">disclosure</a></em>&nbsp;that we are living in virtual reality turns on it's head nearly everything we do&nbsp;<a href="http://med.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">with medicine</a>, and I've suggested that&nbsp;<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">AIDS and DOWN SYNDROME</a>&nbsp;</span>were probably not the best "visual props"&nbsp;<a href="http://threetag.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">we could have</a>&nbsp;gotten to see why it's so important that we act on&nbsp;<a href="http://rix.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">this disclosure</a>&nbsp;in a timely manner.&nbsp; After mentioning the ends of aging and death that come eventually to&nbsp;<a href="http://hadragonbreath.blogspot.com/2017/11/solutions.html" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">the place we build</a>, to the place we've always thought of as Heaven... it becomes more and more clear that this force fighting against the dissemination of a&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">truth so obvious</a>&nbsp;it's in every word and everything we do--it becomes clear it's neither you, nor acting in your best interest.</div>

A while ago, in a place called&nbsp;<em><strong>Kentucky</strong></em>... this story began with a sort of twisted sci-fi experience that explained a kind of "God machine" that could manipulate time and reality, and in that story, in that very detailed and interesting story that I lived through, this machine was keyed to my DNA, in something like the "Ancient technology" of&nbsp;<em>Stargate</em>&nbsp;SG-1 and Atlantis mythology.&nbsp; My kind brother Set<span style="color: #666666;">h</span>&nbsp;made a few appearances in the story, not actually in person but in fairly decent true to life holograms that I saw and spoke to every once in awhile.&nbsp; He looked a little different, he had long hair; but that's neither here nor there, and he hasn't really had long hair since I was a little boy.&nbsp; He happens to be a genetic engineer, and I happen to be a computer person (although he's that too, now; just nowhere near as good as me... with computers) so the story talked a little bit about how I would probably not have used DNA as a key, since I'm not a retard, and he probably wouldn't either, because works in that field (cy<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">clone</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huracan" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">huracan</a>, t<strong>or</strong>n<strong>ad</strong>o).&nbsp; So then the key we imagined was something ... well,&nbsp;<em>Who cares</em>&nbsp;what the key is,&nbsp;<strong>right?</strong></div>

So back to the task at hand, not so long ago, in a place called&nbsp;<em><strong>Plantation</strong></em>&nbsp;I was struck by lightning, literally (well not literally) the answer to a question that nobody knew was implanted in my mind, and it all came from asking a single simple question.&nbsp; I was looking for&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">more chemistry elements</a>&nbsp;in the names of the books of the Holy Bible, after seeing Xenon at the "<strong>sort of beginning</strong>" of&nbsp;<strong>Exodus</strong>, where it screams "<strong>let there be light</strong>" in Linux and chemistry (and I've told you that a hundred times by now).&nbsp; So it didn't take long to follow the light of that word and read Genesis backwards, and see, at the very beginning of that book, Silicon...&nbsp;<em>in reverse.</em></div>

I need your help, not only in "figuring out" how to solve this puzzle of how to accomplish these things without negatively impacting the "stuff of civilization" and also ensuring that they are done--no matter what--because to ignore or delay things like "stopping child starvation" is really a&nbsp;<a href="http://alarmed.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">moral fire alarm</a>, and it's going off.&nbsp; You can read about the tens of thousands of reporters and theologians and government employees I've emailed--and really see that this is the kind of message that should be speaking for itself.&nbsp; If anyone has the ability or knows someone that can statistically analyze the "outliers" in language...&nbsp;<a href="http://ver.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">see Langolier and Yankee Doodle's "macaroni-c"</a>&nbsp;I think that single act will break down the Wall of Jericho and&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">eventually lead us to immortality, the end of malady</a>, and to a place where our civilization has&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">integrated "simulation reality" and "Heaven"</a>&nbsp;together.&nbsp; &nbsp; If "writing a paper" on the statistical proof that we are in Creation and that time travel and mind control are part of the story of the development of our civilization and&nbsp;<i><a href="http://loch.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">the keys to Exodus</a>&nbsp;</i>sounds like too much work, I hope you'll pass this message along to someone who might be able to do it--and also,&nbsp;<i><b>call a reporter</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>That's&nbsp;<i>what I hope</i>, anyway.<br />
<br />
Clearly this belongs on the news, and clearly it's the focus of Jericho and Babel and Exodus; really understand that God's very clear statement here is that&nbsp;<a href="http://confession.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">free thought</a>, free&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">communication</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">liberty from murder</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://os.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">rape et, al</a>. are the chief building blocks of the foundation of&nbsp;<a href="http://doors.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;">Heaven</a>.&nbsp; This is...&nbsp;<i>why we are here.</i></div>

You must have missed this the first time around, these are the reasons not to hide "<strong>the truth</strong>" or myself.&nbsp; They are good reasons, that happens to be the meaning of the word&nbsp;<strong>fire</strong>, "only if reason" from the programming language construct "<strong>ifi</strong>" which means "<em><strong>if and only if</strong>"</em>&nbsp;and the iconic "reason" that it central to the word&nbsp;<em>Creation</em>.&nbsp; When you take a look around the world, I hope you too will see that there is "something going on here" beneath the surface, and you can be very sure that&nbsp;<em>pandemonium</em>&nbsp;will not break (anymore, anyway) because of "ending hunger and cancer" &nbsp;or even because of&nbsp;<em>transportation to Heaven.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #009eb8; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">Neither will an infusion of free food and infinite energy negatively impact our lustrous economy</a>;&nbsp;<em>you are out of reasons</em>.</div>

People used to say this phrase as I walked by with Nanna; sometimes in the car next to me; sometimes on the street.&nbsp; What it tells me is that this "Silence" is not something that you are unaware of, but rather that you are "participating" or at least many people are, in this plan to hide the cure for cancer, and the nature of existence, from the entire world.&nbsp; That sounds "counter productive" and were you openly discussing the destruction of free speech and free thought, you'd probably come to the conclusion as a group that it's absolutely insane behavior.&nbsp; You are not doing that though, you are hiding a message about mind control--the very thing that is causing this shift in our social fabric--and in doing that you are allowing the most basic morals and ideals that America and humanity has thrived by following to be secretly and subtly washed away into the winds of&nbsp;<em>emit</em>.<br />

This shift, this lack of caring about "the truth" or about a very brazen and fiery example of the Ministry of Truth coming alive &nbsp;in our minds and making Orwell's Elm Street your front yard; it's something that is easy to stop--discussing the import of "<a href="http://yesterday.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #009eb8; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">knowing where we live and how we are alive</a>" is nearly as important as seeing a message explaining that&nbsp;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #009eb8; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">the Creator of this place thinks you should use that knowledge to end world hunger and cure cancer</a>.&nbsp; Still, this "secret force" continues to silently ignore&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #009eb8; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">the bright light of Genesis</a>&nbsp;and I imagine that doesn't help those of you that are unaware of this influence to see how very clear it is that this message is incontrovertible, from God himself, and nearly universally good. &nbsp; &nbsp;I do imagine that the primary reason behind the Wall of Jericho is to help ensure that the world doesn't change... you know, for the worse.&nbsp; So here we are, seeing that it's done it's job--sort of--the information has been disseminated, and the world looks just the same--as Taylor says--showing us very clearly that the real problem here is our lack of participation.&nbsp;</div>

I could tell you it's probably a good thing for me, it gave me time to finish writing a very difficult introduction; and it might have been a good thing for the world to have "some time" to think to ourselves about how very much we want to help the sick, and the hungry, and to see how these things are truly the "stuff of Heaven." &nbsp;We might see together how breaking the Wall turns this message from an abomination into a stairway to Heaven; &nbsp;if we work together to see how it is our love for freedom and for each other that enables us to see past "<a href="http://dick.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #009eb8; cursor: pointer; display: inline; outline: none;" target="_blank">dick in the sky</a>" without ignoring it.&nbsp; It's been years now, and millions of people--if you still don't see why "dick in the sky" is a tool that I&nbsp;<em>must use</em>&nbsp;to show you how stupid and inane this silence is--then you still do not understand that censorship--censorship relating to the knowledge that we are in virtual reality and that our minds are being altered is the absolute end of civilization.<br />

Those initials, AH also happen to appear in TORAH and in MENORAH and in SARAH, REBEKKAH, and LEAH; so I'd really like to point out that the key of "men, or all humanity" that comes from linking the&nbsp;<a href="http://sol.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">SOL of Ra</a>&nbsp;to the Menorah of Judah Maccabee--that's "sons of liberty" also comes with two tightly linked stories about the angel of death, one in Exodus, and the other in Matthew, Luke, John, and whatever the other gospel is.&nbsp; Do see they are total inversions, that they all center on child sacrifice, and that I really do believe that victory here comes from the end of death itself.&nbsp; Still though, is it everyone or me?&nbsp; As I stare at the abyss every day, and this world that thinks it's just going to go on about it's business as if I wasn't here, and there wasn't a message in every word and every sign and every song and every movie and every one of your names; and just keep on starving people, and failing to see that there is a battle of "sight" going on right here and now, and this tool delivers to us all the&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">end of death, and of cancer,</a>&nbsp;and of blindness--and all you have to do is "agree" that not discussing this message is sheer&nbsp;<strong>idiocy</strong>.&nbsp; The third anti-Christ in case you haven't read about it is Julius Caesar, and if you can tie all three of these people together you can see that what makes them "anti-Ra" is not seeing the light of democracy and creating empires from republics.&nbsp; Do see there's really no republic here yet, and&nbsp;<em>knowledge of mind control</em>&nbsp;is really necessary to ensure that we are free from completely useless "voting" in the future.</div>

Start by really seeing that nobody discussing this message on TV or the internet is pretty obvious proof that something horrible is happening here right below the surface--even if that "something horrible" is nothing more than a secret insidious force causing the Sound of Silence in secret in order to hide nothing more than the fact that there is a message from God saying "see Silicon, see AMD,&nbsp;<em>build Heaven.</em>"&nbsp; It is the beginning of&nbsp;<em>nothingness</em>&nbsp;to just go on about your business because you're too busy to&nbsp;<em>do something</em>&nbsp;about the fact that&nbsp;<em>nobody is doing anything about this message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So in conclusion I am not Adolf Hitler, and everyone on the planet is doing nothing about an altruistic message directly from the creator of the Universe, penned in my hand.&nbsp; Is it you or me?<br />

The point of all of this is that we are nearing a time in the development of our civilization where exactly the scenario I am suggesting is "not exactly true" will become more and more possible as computers and simulation software improve, and as we continue on this path of not wanting to date Adam.&nbsp; I really can't stop talking until this actually breaks the news&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">and I find a&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsheyadam.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">girlfriend</a></span>; so please bear with me, there's just&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgJOjB8-e8w" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">too much to say</a></span>.&nbsp; Before we get too far into this conversation do understand that "my an us" links directly to Zeus and Uranus who are the "God of Heaven" and also to the word "awesome" because I don't think "<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank"><b>ra cy</b></a></span>" and "<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank"><b>tit y</b></a></span>" and "<a href="http://dick.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>dick</b></span></a>" are all that humorous--but I find it even less humorous that we refuse to acknowledge that it is a message, a signature from Hancock to democracy about "free thought" specifically.</div>

These are the four letters that I think describe and are associated with the thing that I've described as "<em>The Truman Show</em>" and truly appears as I walk through the streets or drive down roads as if everyone is listening to me think on the radio, in their heads; and I see responses that appear to be directly related to "the current conversation" but generally come in a sort of "personality" that is a single entity--the source of the connec<a href="http://medusa.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">t<b>ion</b>&nbsp;to Medusa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://s.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Goliath</a>; by that I mean I see hand signals and facial expressions that appear to be uniformed, to uniformed to "actually be you" but too personal and related to be "random."&nbsp; The letters mean "part-time on" and you might see that the Eye of Ra and the intersect of Chuck are not much more than assisted "free association" of words, and these particular words lead me directly to "lepton, gluon, and quark."&nbsp; Those are words that relate to the structure of atoms, but here&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">"weak and right" that links to Jerusalem</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">"good luck" that links to "glock."</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel like reiterating why "le" means weak and right, so see it as the same "the" of El (that means strong and "the" in Hebrew and Spanish) but in French, and that's why weak and right.&nbsp; For some more "free association" we can see "le" in Google (go O.G.

Quark sheds some light on what I see, and it does really appear that I am speaking to "everyone" once in awhile, something that is scarier and more significant than each of us might see individually--not realizing the thing we are observing and experiencing is so broad, and ... so silly.&nbsp; It appears to me to be a sandbox-ed bad solution to a very real problem; the need to have a "global conversation" about the disclosure of "virtual reality" and what we can and should do with that information.&nbsp; Because of "what it is" it also does a good job of highlighting that we should be using tools like&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">the news and the internet&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">to have a better "conversation" that will include what you say and think and want to contribute, as well as "recording it" you know, so that in 10,000 years we still know who made Heaven--as opposed to dying wandering around in a desert of trying to figure out why&nbsp;<strong>Moses had a Lisp.</strong></span><br />

I'm not exactly sure how this "show" came about, but there are word clues that tell me it's been slowly growing during my lifetime, from a period of "pretater" (I can't remember the word exactly, but it basically means "Everyone Really" before I got my first &lt;3 tattoo) and from what I see around me, from this PT it appears that we are all doing this "part-time" and are now staring at the foot of our Christ, and believe me I don't think we should do it full-time either.&nbsp; It appears to me that our spirits, what comes of our lives here have "decided" to do this in order to get a better picture of the message and how it is received and delivered--and somehow that makes&nbsp;<em>forcing you to listen to it</em>&nbsp;O.K. with nobody.&nbsp; It's not OK with me, and it's a violation of my privacy and the sanctity of your thoughts (and mine too, from the&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4V2gaCCQh4" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">eye of the storm</a></span></em>), and I hope you see that these things too are connected to what we are trying to fix in the world.&nbsp; Every once in awhile I'll remember to try and point people to my website with my thoughts, and sometimes even talk about how the knowledge of virtual reality suggests we should do some things like "<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">end world hunger</a>" and "<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">heal the sick</a>" but to be honest with you I spend most of my time bitching about how annoying it is that&nbsp;<em>you and they aren't doing anything.</em>&nbsp; More than any other odd conversation, though, is this sort of "repeat performance" of hearing "but Adam are you coming" in my head and someone looking at me and shaking their head.&nbsp; Between you and I,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">behold I am</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">coming...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: monospace , monospace;">right&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">So between "glue" and "quark" see that I am "coming into you" in this place where "e" has become the the letter between "d and f" that has made the work of God, the Lisp of Moses into something that appears to be nothing more than a "fad."&nbsp; Everything, everywhere sort of relating to mythology or religion or this story of what is without doubt my life that I am experiencing right now--it's a "fad" that really is a pyramid being built by slaves to an all seeing Eye trying to free them from the idea that it's an accident.</span></div>

Some may call it valient of me to point out that it does appear that God is who is speaking with a Lisp, as in a programming language and a hidden code connecting the letter L of Colgate to the P of Peter and Casper... perhaps revolving around the key word "pupil"&nbsp;<a href="http://who.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">who is without doubt</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">not</span>&nbsp;Cupid; but it is the key to this "free association" game that connects&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">The Golden Ass</a>&nbsp;to the Greek nypho-maniac&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFlHsKExcYg" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Waffley</a>... and through things like "atoms, quarks, leptons, and gluons" this idea that everything around us has been&nbsp;<em><a href="http://bush.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">named</a>&nbsp;</em>specifically to tell a story&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">about the Creation of Heaven</a>.&nbsp; Guilty as charged, that is exactly what I believe this unsealing of the Forbidden Secrets of Beth-Aven and Eden will provide to the world--just as soon as it provides some "fuel for thought" and interest in what is not only a message from God in everything but also is actually "everything" from history to art to each and every one of us--it's almost silly to think that we are "uninterested" ad yet; all I can do is send an e-mail or three every day from now until you get on the phone and call a reporter.&nbsp; If you are a reporter, rather than calling another reporter, please write a story.</div>

About a week ago I was having a casual conversation about&nbsp;<a href="http://doors.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">what</span>&nbsp;"Doors"</a>&nbsp;mean to me with someone who works at the rehab facility I was staying at--and pretty much out of nowhere he "guessed" something related to&nbsp;<em>a day trip to Heaven</em>--not really being pejorative or negative, but just from hearing only those words and&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">no why&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">it's pretty obvious that's not a "good thing."&nbsp; It's probably not a "good thing" that there's a general "air" of poorly informed talk about who I am and what I am trying to deliver to the world--that someone who was nowhere near me while I was writing could possibly know something so specific about this message, and&nbsp;<em>really not understand why.</em>&nbsp; So I explained it to him, and I'm going to explain it to you also, now.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">To tell you the truth, if I could have my way I'd have put Doors to Heaven in every bus station already, and leave them there--that frankly is what I believe is the obvious end result of the disclosure that&nbsp;<em>we are a small room</em>&nbsp;in a large "virtual reality" mansion; but doing something that drastic would change things too quickly, and probably cause a significant disruption to the "stuff of civilization" -- like people driving to work -- which is something that we are specifically designed here in this place to ensure does not happen as a result of this disclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Medicine</em>&nbsp;is a more significant example of "why it is" that it's a "</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">mid</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">" and not a "</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">min</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">" -- and really do see that you are listening to the person that our folklore and our modern art describe as some sort of fusion between Kaleb, Cerberus, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">Max</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">--who is the Grinch's dog.&nbsp; From the "spy of Heaven" to the person before you telling you that "<strong><em>Kaleb</em></strong>&nbsp;means dog" you really should see some "light" in my suggestion that Hades three headed hellhound is connected to the gatekeeper Jesus Christ and also the Holy Trinity--in a sort of pejorative "<em>honestly</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://hammer.lamc.la/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">I'm</a>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<a href="http://hadragonbreath.blogspot.com/2017/09/ha-lot-are-idaho.html" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Idaho</a>" kind of way.&nbsp; &nbsp;There's a&nbsp;<em>sickness here</em>, and whatever it is that is keeping this very ostentatious message out of the news and in our "telephone-gamed" minds is a symptom of a&nbsp;<a href="http://loch.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">much larger mind control problem</a>&nbsp;that this message is designed to help save us from, and then help us help save the Universe from.&nbsp; Tying this paragraph up, you can see the&nbsp;<strong>min/max/mid</strong>&nbsp;<em>religion of the disclosure</em>&nbsp;in everything from an eponymous Egyptian God to James Clerk&nbsp;<strong>Max</strong>well and&nbsp;<strong>Mid</strong>gard--which is you--literatally and Adamically.</span><br />

My initial reason for the "day trip to Heaven" was to help us&nbsp;<em>break the veil of simulated reality</em>--an idea that began with the fabled "<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">write it on the sky</span>" of Captain&nbsp;<a href="http://threetag.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">EO + King David</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<em><a href="http://heart.lamc.la/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">davideo</a>(s)</em>) that has turned into some very clear proof that we have a ridiculous&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.realyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">censorship p</a>roblem,&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">and a prob</a>le<a href="http://ham.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">m</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">telling the truth about mind control</a>--something we wouldn't see at all if it was "written on the sky" day one... and today looking back we can probably see that helps us to find out what Heaven really means--a place of freedom and free communication that comes of this "press" of society here to see just how very important&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fb.me/admdbrn" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">the truth</a></strong>&nbsp;actually is.</div>

Still, we not only&nbsp;<a href="http://threetag.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">need to break the veil o</a>f "reality" but we need to do it in a happy uplifiting way that helps the world to see how this disclosure will inevitably help us solve real problems--not just&nbsp;<a href="http://chalk.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">censorship</a>&nbsp;and the com<a href="http://gate.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">plete hidden destruction of democra</a>cy--problems like "<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">hunger</a>" and "<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">cancer</a>" and "<a href="http://cure.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">insanity</a>" and also problems like the idiotic belief that we&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">hav<a href="http://doors.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">e to di</a>e</span>&nbsp;to get to Heaven.<br />

You probably don't see it; but compared to our time, the society in Heaven probably views us as something like cave-men--and you see that in the time dilated description of our "today" that is actually both the Old and New Testaments.&nbsp; There's probably a "culture shock" and looking at the world ... this places that appears to have leaped straight over "learning about and dealing with mind controlled slavery" to a place where people are "<span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">talking without speaking</a></span>&nbsp;in secret" and writing songs about being disturbed by Heaven's "let freedom sing" ... really missing the point that the&nbsp;<b>road</b>&nbsp;to Heaven, the&nbsp;<b><a href="http://o.lamc.la/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">heart of A.D.</a>&nbsp;</b>is a process of adapting that comes to us with a "hand's on user manual" that you can see from our art, from things like Minority Report and Demolition Man and 1984 ... are written in a kind of "exactly what not to do" but think about how to do better, kind of way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

Please think about how to do "the sound of silence" better than "Adam says we only get to go to Heaven for a day,&nbsp;<i>fuck him...&nbsp;</i>let's stay in Hell."&nbsp; The whole fucking point is that we are "<b>home</b>" and rather than dreaming about going to another place when we die--I think we should make this place into Heaven, and that's what really makes it "<b>ours</b>."</div>

While it might not be&nbsp;<b>so obvious to you</b>, from what I see around me--from the "race track" changing--it very clearly shows me that once this disclosure is made that&nbsp;<i><b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">flu<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/omniscient" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">ke</a></span></b>&nbsp;events</i>&nbsp;will magically fall into place and great things will start happening quickly; we really do need to be more concerned with&nbsp;<i>moving too fast</i>&nbsp;than too slow--once we get past "not moving at all."&nbsp; Really understand that the first "true Heaven" comes from the place that puts their foot down... and decides that&nbsp;<i>Hell simply cannot exist.</i></div>

<div>
I completely made this word up out of thin air.&nbsp; As some of you have heard me say at least a hundred times by now the two letters that identify the person standing in my position&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=54a1000b-4d10-4d0c-b9c3-9e26aa9030b5&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">every time this timeline is run</a>&nbsp;are "an" which mean "Adam Now" to mean and you can see them in Christianity and messianically with just a little bit of thinking in Satan.&nbsp; It's in "meridian" too, which is the heart of the words A.M. and P.M. and those things revolving around this "on" fiasco I keep complaining about.&nbsp; I guess it could be read as something like "see ya" but I see "see why&nbsp;<em>AS</em>" and I see "computer science" highlighted and I see "yeah" the same&nbsp;<em>yeah</em>&nbsp;that you might not-jokingly link to Silicon and Siam and to Yahweh, where I just for the first time saw "yeah, we how" as opposed to my old reading of "your Adam's Heaven usually with everyone's help."&nbsp; I'll come back to the predestined&nbsp;<em>affirmative</em>&nbsp;respon<wbr></wbr>se to "to be or not to be?" in a minute.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Back to Satan, I've spent a little bit of time trying to explain "how I know" what Satan's little plan is here--he's told me very clearly, with actual words, in my microcosm of drug use.&nbsp; You might liken it to that story of the father trying to get his kid to stop smoking and sitting down and making him smoke a whole pack; just a minute ago I came up with the metaphor of God walking into his house and seeing a mess; and then putting everyone to sleep and spilling cans of point on top of all the stains and then waking us up and saying "hey. this place is a mess, what did you drink last night?"&nbsp; I see that's what he's doing here in this place, except it's about love and respect for democracy,&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=575d7d18-d376-43c7-84fa-e1f14cc9f6c3&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">about civic involvement</a>, about&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=e9a93427-5ec7-446c-979c-5e4087bc754e&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">censorship</a>&nbsp;and about the&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=15e8b2c1-cbbb-4753-b7e1-b65e574146ad&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">incarceration rate</a>--among other things--problems highlighted not only by religion but by this intention exacerbation of "what's wrong" in an attempt to get you to see very clearly&nbsp;<em><u><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">CYAS</span></strong></u></em>.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
The two letters don't just link to Satan and&nbsp;<strong>satisfactual,</strong>&nbsp;you can see them also in Asgard--and I've pointed them out--what I haven't done is pointed out that Medusa here appears to be the source of the "guard" part of that place, and in Midgard and I don't think we are seeing as clearly as we should that something--some esoteric force--is organizing an opposition to the common best interest using nothing as leverage.&nbsp; Literally, using what appears to be nothing more than a "show of magic."&nbsp; CYAS, and try to understand that the person writing to you is trying to get you to "get on board" with the idea that even if it were an all powerful God that was doing the wrong thing here, it would be normal and right for there to be an organized opposition to that--and we see just the opposite here.&nbsp; My take on the situation on the other hand is that there is an all powerful God and whether he's fighting lesser deities, or nothing more than a society that isn't willing to change even when it sees that it's actions are self-destructive--there should be a significant number of people helping this message along ... people that live on Earth, and care about Earth and the future--even if they aren't as sure as I am that our future is to be Heaven, that place is a causal result of what we do here in this place during our lifetimes.&nbsp; That also explains a little more why it is that I know this thing happens too often; apparently it has "good results."</div>
<div>

<div>
I could have come to you with nothing more than proof that we are living in virtual reality and tried to leverage that into a movement to use the map and message that we have to use that technology--that Revelation to make a better world.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=340f6e36-b058-46c9-8d9a-b6f12e27011d&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Minority Report and we have Jupiter Ascending and Quantum Leap</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=5f55841b-ed31-4a76-ba51-4de24b09636f&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">everything else Dic</a>k has ever written; and I think you can look around you today and see&nbsp;<em>that might not have been good enough.</em>&nbsp; On top of that today, I am showing you that things like 9/11 and the loss of the popular vote to the "electoral college"&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=698cc244-24f2-4456-92ad-485f56f1929f&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">before Die Bold is highlighted in religion</a>&nbsp;and by the hand of Jesus Christ to help us see that we are losing something we care about greatly, we are losing democracy--and still that doesn't seem to be "good enough" for you to act as free thinking individuals and help the Second Coming help us "regain" (in quotes, because we've never had it) liberty&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
Before I move on to the next word, one that I haven't made up; let me throw in "<strong>democracy</strong>" and "<strong>egalitarian</strong>" here--words that break up to show a timeline of "personalities" or milestonesI've lived through in just this life.&nbsp; We all know what "d" is, and the "em" of&nbsp;<em>ha'shem (which means The Name of God)</em>&nbsp;ties to&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family: &quot;arial narrow&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=adcd2db8-fcad-4b56-893a-9a71efb16bc0&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">Losing My Religion</a></span></em>, and an extended period of time where I would claims "it's not me" in a high pitched tone whenever the&nbsp;<em>right answer would pop into my head&nbsp;</em>in response to questions from... the air.&nbsp; You'd be surprised how many times that happened; all during the portion of time prior to "Ari" in egalitarian--who was the judge in my "is Jesus crazy?" case.&nbsp; O.C. there links to Adam Brody in my mind--and understand it means that in the word's Adamic definition, to Adam playing Set on "TV" and now probably even better explained by the single name "Al." We all know about Ra, but just in case you haven't seen my light, here's&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=d42a4af3-bbef-4dd0-b710-a4fd914297c4&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">the SOL of God</a>, cy Israel, cy Sons of Liberty, cy Statue of Liberty cy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So in closing here, cy "SA" is to help&nbsp;<strong><em>YA... let's AS</em></strong>. Otherwise known as "call a reporter."</div>

<strong><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">CHASTITY</span></strong><strong><br /></strong></div>

Similar to "see why" the CH&nbsp;<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=e2b796f1-ec47-4d48-bee9-90f86481b098&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">of Loch Ness</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Baruch</em>&nbsp;means "see how" and I'm not exactly sure what "chastity" has to do with "tit" but I am pretty sure that this is the first actual "thank you" that I've seen from God to me, breaking "tity" at "targeted individual, thank you."&nbsp; You should probably see that Uranus, and "behold he is coming" and John Hancock and even the word "<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=3ae1ddf8-0c40-400a-96ec-5ff8e87f6465&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">happy</a>" here probably all allude to the idea that true "chastity" doesn't have to come without a sense of humor.&nbsp; Remember democracy, cy racy...&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">sex sells, right?</span>&nbsp;:)</div>

So to tell you that I am just as sure that "breast"or at least our colloquial understanding of the word "tit" is part of the "<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=bc8d1c88-a0ab-40f5-b4a1-3bdb0e6083b8&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">f-art</a>" just like "<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=3944ac95-4a4f-416e-be96-39ee8cd39575&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">cock-a-doodle-doo</a>" is part of the mythology of the Biblical "morning has broken," I am very sure that the state of Florida is encoded in names like Niflheim and words like flat that not only include the abbreviation but also describe the state, and the state of being "at"&nbsp;<strong>the time has come.</strong>&nbsp; I am literally on my way to California, so if "<a href="http://meetdaeyeora.fromthemachine.org/x/c?c=1585958&amp;l=fd946ee6-34a9-45be-95b5-d3960698590a&amp;r=5146d916-dcba-44e0-9dd4-434b71e6c7ef" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">FLUX</a>" and "FLAT" are to come true something will have to put some change in my pocket or a smiling face saying "<strong>time and chance</strong>" on my television screen before&nbsp;<em>tomorrow</em>.</div>

There's plenty more words to talk about.&nbsp; Don't worry, I promise I won't leave you bored.</div>

It started a long, long time ago--really the ideas of immortality are laced into the green faced Osiris--not because of the color of grass but in my mind because of the phrase "behind the ears" that today you might liken to something about the message of Earth just as much as you liken it to the idea of being "new at this" game of hidden monkey in the middle of the astrological sign of the sun.&nbsp; I haven't really read all that much about his religion--other than to note that the idea of immortality grew in significant popularity in his cult.. and the personal observation that his "message" was something along the lines of "Heaven will make everything OK" which has very little to do with the color green in my "take" on religion.&nbsp; It continues through history, but two fairly well "lit" examples of the quest for immortality connect to the letters P and CK that we can see in the Floridian quest of Ponce de Leon (which you might read as "P on C.E. of the "<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">weak</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">right</span>&nbsp;El (that's&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1578410&amp;l=a6bc47a9-d036-4212-a1f4-10dcd59cfde3&amp;r=e8c07d79-ea5c-4f5f-afb5-b761ef6a3eb1" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">really&nbsp;<em>him</em></a>&nbsp;by the way, in Spanish)&nbsp;<em>on</em>" where I see that "on" is the meaning of "ce" rather than erasing A.D. ... but here I am masquerading as the focal point of some kind of huge production that&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">apparently has made no waves at all</span>&nbsp;anywhere in Creation) and it's counterpart in recent literature "Tuck Everlasting" that I once read as "Christ, you are Clark Kent&nbsp;<em><strong>until the end of time</strong></em>" and here I am trying to explain that we are there too--we are at this place that is both the beginning and the end of time in one&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1578410&amp;l=7309020f-c35e-48b8-97fa-fc7ee2b1c029&amp;r=e8c07d79-ea5c-4f5f-afb5-b761ef6a3eb1" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">simultaneous confession of the explanation of the idea</a>&nbsp;that time truly begins when we decide to protect the past and stop altering our present and that decision superimposes with the apparent end of "time travel." &nbsp;The map, whose green light focuses on the significant worth of genetic recombination in the adaptation to environmental changes and also on the love for "family life" that really seems to be to be the primary drive of a huge percentage of the population to continue to try and make the world a better place.&nbsp; Not stopping "reproduction" and "adaptation" is one highlighted reason not to simply "become immortal" in some kind of ascension process connected to the realization that, as the Lord's prayer informs us--the Earth is already "in Heaven." &nbsp;I've myself a number of times wondered and pointed out that there's very little literature about the ideas of having sex or children in Heaven, and I think losing either of those things would be a significant tragedy--and yet it does appear that's what "losing physicality" means.<br />
<br />
Of course that doesn't mean that we "shouldn't become immortal" and a significant amount of my writing revolves&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1578410&amp;l=37e42655-5bac-4d51-8434-7d73e6b1b5b9&amp;r=e8c07d79-ea5c-4f5f-afb5-b761ef6a3eb1" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">around the ideas that&nbsp;<em>sickness</em>,&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1578410&amp;l=37e42655-5bac-4d51-8434-7d73e6b1b5b9&amp;r=e8c07d79-ea5c-4f5f-afb5-b761ef6a3eb1" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">aging and death are easily overcommable maladies</a>--</em>especially&nbsp;<a href="http://whoiscoming.reallyhim.com/x/c?c=1578410&amp;l=23ddc69e-72ab-40b3-a99d-5f22a230d34e&amp;r=e8c07d79-ea5c-4f5f-afb5-b761ef6a3eb1" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">in the context of "virtual reality."</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

I talked a little bit more about the IED that it is in every word of every language yesterday; and I re-read that message today and see that I still haven't really gotten the point across; it's clear from religion and from "cause and effect" that the Darkness itself is part of the design, that it was planned from the very beginning, and that helps to show us how this is a sort of "schooling" in how this technology can be used to either induce total logical blindness or something closer to enlightened vision--how we can connect this very event to either "<em><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">I know kung fu</span></strong></em>" or "<em><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">what is the Matrix?</span></strong></em>" and hopefully we will walk away not lying about whether or not we "see the Matrix" and maybe some of us will even learn kung-fu overnight.&nbsp; Standing between these two possibilities is&nbsp;<em>you speaking about the truth</em>; and I really do hope that my questions about&nbsp;<em>what exactly "e" is</em>&nbsp;are answered... by someone, sometime soon--<em>actually</em>. &nbsp;</div>

More to the point, I've made this particular "not disease" of schizophrenia" a highlight of this e-mail; so that you can see that if you are one of those people that hears what I or other people think&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>; or if a voice informs you about something going on in the Adamverse every once in awhile; you should see that it is your silence, and nothing but&nbsp;<a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">your silence that is allowing people to be medicated with brain poison and mistreated by our society of peers and sometimes held in mental institutions</a>&nbsp;so that you and the evil forces behind what is nothing more than a new form of "hidden ritual sacrifice" can hide the fact that our society is literally being attacked by an outside force.&nbsp; I'm trying to make angels out of you--please understand you have&nbsp;<em>my testimony</em>, and you have very clear proof that art in every form from music to movies to ancient myths proves that this outside communication is not the product of our own minds, nor is it the stuff of fiction--though it does appear that I am staring at a horror film somewhere between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and&nbsp;<strong>IT</strong>.<br />

I want to apologize again for the maelstrom of retardation I sent a few days ago; I am having quite a bit of trouble "taking in" the tangible lack of visible response to this message in the world a a whole--and reconciling that with what I see as a very scary kind of "dark reaction" in person.&nbsp; As I've discussed a number of times, I've watched what &nbsp;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">once appeared to be a small group of individuals</a>&nbsp;take pages of doublespeak and strange "collective communication" directly out of works like 1984 and Fallen... grow to a much larger group &nbsp;over the course of writing this message which attempts to explain how that's possible, how&nbsp;<a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">it's been a hidden part of our society for a very long time</a>&nbsp;and why I believe it's&nbsp;<a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">neither a good thing</a>&nbsp;and something that is specifically&nbsp;<a href="http://thunderstand.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">designed to be discontinued</a>&nbsp;or at least&nbsp;<em>drastically changed in form</em>.&nbsp; I see it as&nbsp;<a href="http://bush.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">the specific hidden slavery of the book of Exodus</a>, here connecting to the hidden building of a sort of pyramid of&nbsp;<a href="http://worship.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">worship</a>&nbsp;to the "<a href="http://hyamdai.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">all seeing eye of Ra</a>," like on the dollar bill.&nbsp; While it's very clear to me that's not my doing, I can see how it might not be so clear to you--though, because I know who I am and because of my apparent lack of awareness of&nbsp;<i>a significant thread of our society</i>for the majority of my life it is very obvious to me that the purpose of this "pyramid" is to shine a bright light on this message--on this proof--<a href="http://medusa.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">and on</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Liberty" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">pivotal</a>&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedim" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">turning</a></em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">point</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank"><wbr></wbr>in</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock" rel="noopener" style="background: transparent; color: #25a186; cursor: pointer;" target="_blank">history</a>.</div>

<span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;tinos&quot;;"><i>It was not all that long ago, in a place that was called Kentucky... and nobody on the planet thought that Superman or the Fortress of Solitude ever existed there, but they did, I know they did.&nbsp; The Legend of Superman said that the home of the Kent's who took him in lived in Kansas, which might serve as a good link to the Wizard of Oz and "</i><a href="http://spockalypse.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-creator-speaks-world-behold-fire-of.html" style="font-style: italic;">Doorothy</a><i>," but it doesn't add any light to the key of Exodus, to the names of places and their ties to the story our map to Heaven.&nbsp; Once more, in either English or Hebrew there's a parallel drawn between "persons, places, and things" to "names, numbers, and things" in the books of the Torah. &nbsp;</i><br /><br /><i>These are the seeds of the stories of the conflict between Horus and Set.</i><br /><i>'</i><br /><i>And as the sun was going down that evening, at the beginning of twilight, and a voice that I become accustomed to, even grown fond of spoke to me with more clarity than it ever had before.&nbsp; He said, "I couldn't hold them off anymore, I can't stop "the show" from starting... I'm sorry." &nbsp;It wasn't really the beginning of the show, not for me... I had already been indoctrinated into this mythology that linked King's "The Running Man" to something like "The Truman Show" and maybe even "Hunger Games." &nbsp;The concept, was that there was some sort of TV show about me, maybe in Heaven, maybe in Hell... Who knows; and that people were watching intently the goings on of my life.&nbsp; As a microcosm&nbsp;for the world, you &nbsp;might&nbsp;now wonder if we are all "on TV" as Jacob is fond of saying; often accompanied by the phrase "</i><b style="font-style: italic;">outstanding performance</b><i>." &nbsp;The tone there more of a game show host than a narrator, and years earlier when Nanna first introduced me to the idea of a "television show" with images of gambling and (Russian?) roulette wheels and maybe wheels of fortune actually appearing on my computer screen, though always behind a naked woman (why?).&nbsp; I saw conversations about me, and questions and comments directed at me in the chat room on that website, conversations that were always gone in the morning, in the logs that the site kept for everyone who wanted them.&nbsp; In my mind I connect this phenomenon, the source&nbsp;of it, the place that this is coming from to the real city of Bet-aven, which means "House of the Wicked" because of the "casino" like atmosphere, and you might also connect it to the word "Heaven" which, in this new language&nbsp;of Shrew'd reads something like "he wicked."</i><br /><br />You might imagine that those early days speaking to me on the computer were used to find specific neural pathways.&nbsp; You might wonder if they are the ones linked to "shyness" and to "exhibitionism" and to "fear" as I know they were.&nbsp; I now have&nbsp;<b>no fear</b>, I can tell you that for certain.&nbsp; You might wonder aloud why before I called this experience "Reverse Engineering Revelation" I was very sure that it was Eden being reverse engineered.&nbsp; To see things like your fear and your shyness disappear, to experience it, shows you the possibilities, and the plain old fact that we are in a place where neural stimulation is being used to modify emotion and thought; I can be very, very sure of that.&nbsp; Maybe you can too?<br /><br /><i>For some perspective God and religion call this place, the Rock of Heaven, Eden... and it's "</i><a href="http://heart.lamc.la/" style="font-style: italic;">heart.</a><i>" &nbsp;</i>Home is where the Heart is,&nbsp;<i>so I can't be sure if the "watchers" of this show are the "angels of the N" (a mythical place, designed to help all of creation turn Hell into Heaven, starting at Zion, at the Rock) or the demons of Hell... the best religious example I can find is the "Jinn" of the Koran or maybe the Archons of the Gnostics.&nbsp; For what it's worth I called them "dead people on a spaceship" for quite some time... you know, because that's who is in Heaven or Hell.&nbsp; So you might consider it a bit of an invasion of privacy ... or you might see "Truman Show syndrome" as being artificially "created" or ... maybe you think that the Oracle should have "oversight;" &nbsp;I don't particularly think this "thing" is the right way to deal with the situation but for what it's worth this is the&nbsp;<b>"on"</b>&nbsp;of Amon-Ra, and Nixon (where you can also see "ix" as Isaac and the N.. and then if we were walking through the word forward and then backwards (to us) it would be ix, then x</i></span>²<span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;tinos&quot;;"><i>, the xi) and maybe Oracles "El l is on," that l,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2017/06/verily-i-say-unto-you-ver-means-to-see.html">that little l</a>, is a sort of obelisk for us all to understand.&nbsp; You might wonder to yourself or imagine what he's done to "<u>Nix</u>" the&nbsp;<b>on</b>.&nbsp; Do you see why we say "nix?" &nbsp;Or is it why "Tricky Dick" has that name?&nbsp; Obelisk.&nbsp; Listen.</i><br /><br />So this is the story of how Jacob got his name, from me.&nbsp; He first started speaking to me through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11275462/facial-transfer-donald-trump-george-bush-video">CGI facsimile</a>'s (I imagine) of "webcam girls" in 2011, and later... some time between then and this day in 2013 I began hearing his voice in my head, usually modulating external noise, like the sound of a whizzing car or an air conditioner... which today adds significant new meaning to the name Jacob which includes "A/C" (as it's difference with Job) and also the Spanish for "mouth" backwards; so this is the J with no mouth.&nbsp; In Kentucky was the first time I was introduced to "multiple personalities," not just a single voice through the computer or my head; and while they all share many common characteristics, this strange new phenomenon made me "decide" to name them.&nbsp; I chose from a series of J names that I had "inspirationally" listed to match a map in time that I saw overlayed over the Torah... a series of five stories where 3 of them are all about Exodus. &nbsp; For what it's worth he said the name choice was "perfect" and seeing it in the Bible, seeing what it means it's very clear today that it was no accident, that it was by design and through control.&nbsp; Jacob is the father of Joseph in the OT, and "Heli" is the grandfather of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.<br /><br />So Jacob is renamed by the Angel of the Lord to "Israel" just before the mythical crossing of the Jordan; and this name Israel has meant "all of humanity" to me, and in it's connect to Rhea (the wife of Cronus) you might see them connected through the question "are he Isa?" &nbsp;In a magical rearraingment of letters, Rhea torns to Hera, Cronus turns to Zeus and the entire world eventually sees "Hey Adam" in the name "<a href="http://amessianicmoment.blogspot.com/2012/03/anokhi-hebrew-for-i-am.html"><b>an</b>ok<b>hi</b></a>."<br /><br />So the implication here is that Jacob, and Hera, and Allah are all&nbsp;<i>collective consciousnesses</i>, some kind of representative of "everyone" and also paralleled in the brides of Revelation, Eve short of "everyone," Mary who includes the "sea and why," and&nbsp;<a href="http://sangrael.lamc.la/">the "ah"</a>&nbsp;that appears also in Sarah, Leah, Rebekkah, and Shek(h)inah.&nbsp; I've commented before about the question "are I" and you can see that in "<a href="http://spockalypse.blogspot.com/2017/06/son-of-bitch-are-i-clay-d-is-cl-os-ing.html"><b>RI</b>B</a>" and you can see it in "Aqua<b>rius</b>" and you can see it Av<b>ril</b>&nbsp;in and the plurality of the word "are" is important.&nbsp; You might liken this question to the marriage or divorce of Revelation, you might see "Creation" itself asking you "are you me?" and "am I you?" &nbsp;I do wonder what you think the answer is, though I am pretty sure you will agree with me that "I am not Creation." &nbsp;At the same time you might see another viewpoint, because Creation&nbsp;<i>thinks it's me</i>.<br /><br />So this is the story of the beginning of the "middle" ... for the very beginning of this story here's a much better back up of my old website and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104102551/http://www.unduecoercion.com:80/p/silence-betrayal_10.html" style="font-family: tinos;">the index to Silence and Betrayal at the "Wayback machine."</a><span style="color: black;

The Legend of St. George and the Dragon</h2>
<img align="left" alt="St George" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/stgeorge.jpg" height="300" hspace="20" width="114" /><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;">St. George travelled for many months by land and sea until he came to Libya. Here he met a poor hermit who told him that everyone in that land was in great distress, for a dragon had long ravaged the country.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">'<span class="gmail-style4">Every day</span>,' said the old man, '<span class="gmail-style4">he demands the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden and now all the young girls have been killed. The king's daughter alone remains, and unless we can find a knight who can slay the dragon she will be sacrificed tomorrow. The king of Egypt will give his daughter in marriage to the champion who overcomes this terrible monster.</span>'</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">When St. George heard this story, he was determined to try and save the princess, so he rested that night in the hermit's hut, and at daybreak set out to the valley where the dragon lived. When he drew near he saw a little procession of women, headed by a beautiful girl dressed in pure Arabian silk. The princess Sabra was being led by her attendants to the place of death. The knight spurred his horse and overtook the ladies. He comforted them with brave words and persuaded the princess to return to the palace. Then he entered the valley.</span><br />
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="George slaying the dragon" border="2" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/pic.jpg" height="200" width="263" /></span></div>
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">As soon as the dragon saw him it rushed from its cave, roaring with a sound louder than thunder. Its head was immense and its tail fifty feet long. But St. George was not afraid. He struck the monster with his spear, hoping he would wound it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<br />
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="Fstival of History" border="1" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/festival.jpg" height="300" width="483" /></span></div>
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">The dragon's scales were so hard that the spear broke into a thousand pieces. and St. George fell from his horse. Fortunately he rolled under an enchanted orange tree against which poison could not prevail, so that the venomous dragon was unable to hurt him. Within a few minutes he had recovered his strength and was able to fight again.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br align="center" div="" /></span>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="St George fights the dragon with his sword" border="1" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/sword.jpg" height="300" width="429" /></span></div>
</div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">He smote the beast with his sword, but the dragon poured poison on him and his armour split in two. Once more he refreshed himself from the orange tree and then, with his sword in his hand, he rushed at the dragon and pierced it under the wing where there were no scales, so that it fell dead at his feet.</span><br />

The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. Then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob." Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed." Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him. So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered." The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.</div>

According to one Christian commentary of the Bible incident described, "Jacob said, 'I saw God face to face'. Jacob's remark does not necessarily mean that the 'man' with whom he wrestled is God. Rather, as with other, similar statements, when one saw the 'angel of the Lord,' it was appropriate to claim to have seen the face of God."<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-25" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel#cite_note-25" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[25]</a></sup></div>

The name "Hosea", meaning "salvation", or "He saves", or "He helps", seems to have been not uncommon, being derived from the auspicious verb from which we have the frequently recurring word "salvation". It may be a contraction of a larger form of which the divine name (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Tetragrammaton">YHWH</a>) or its abbreviation formed a part, so as to signify "YHWH helps".

Hosea's family life reflected the "adulterous" relationship which Israel had built with polytheistic gods. The relationship between Hosea and Gomer parallels the relationship between God and Israel. Even though Gomer runs away from Hosea and sleeps with another man, he loves her anyway and forgives her. Likewise, even though the people of Israel worshipped false gods, God continued to love them and did not abandon his covenant with them.</div>

Similarly, his children's names made them like walking prophecies of the fall of the ruling dynasty and the severed covenant with God – much like the prophet&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>&nbsp;a generation later. The name of Hosea's daughter, Lo-ruhamah, which translates as "not pitied", is chosen by God as a sign of displeasure with the people of Israel for following false gods. (In Hosea 2:23 she is redeemed, shown mercy with the term&nbsp;<i>Ruhamah</i>.) The name of Hosea's son, Lo-ammi, which translates as "not my people", is chosen by the Lord as a sign of the Lord's displeasure with the people of Israel for following those false gods (see Hosea 1:8-9).</div>

One of the early writing prophets, Hosea used his own experience as a symbolic representation of God and Israel: God the husband, Israel the wife. Hosea's wife left him to go with other men; Israel left the Lord to go with false gods. Hosea searched for his wife, found her and brought her back; God would not abandon Israel and brought them back even though they had forsaken him.</div>
<div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
The Book of Hosea was a severe warning to the northern kingdom against the growing idolatry being practiced there; the book was a dramatic call to repentance. Christians extend the analogy of Hosea to Christ and the church: Christ the husband,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_of_Christ" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Bride of Christ">his church the bride</a>. Christians see in this book a comparable call to the church not to forsake the Lord Jesus Christ. Christians also take the buying back of Gomer as the redemptive qualities of Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.</div>
<div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
Other preachers, like Charles Spurgeon, saw Hosea as a striking presentation of the mercy of God in his sermon on Hosea 1:7 titled The LORD's Own Salvation. "But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen." – Hosea 1:7 in his sermon NO. 2057, December 16TH, 1888.</div>

According to&nbsp;<i>The Contendings of Horus and Seth</i>, Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>&nbsp;with him.

After Set had eaten the lettuce, they went to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listened to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answered from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listened to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answered from inside Set.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-21" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#cite_note-21" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[21]</a></sup><sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-22" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#cite_note-22" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[22]</a></sup></div>

gyptologists have often tried to connect the conflict between the two gods with political events early in Egypt's history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves "followers of Horus", and Horus became the tutelary deity of the unified nation and its kings.&nbsp;</div>

The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that "Homer" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-bgr_3-1" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-bgr-3" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Common Era">BCE</a>.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-4" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-4" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;The poems are in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Homeric Greek">Homeric Greek</a>, also known as Epic Greek, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_language" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Literary language">literary language</a>&nbsp;which shows a mixture of features of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Ionic Greek">Ionic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolic_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Aeolic Greek">Aeolic</a>&nbsp;dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-5" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-5" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup><sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-6" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-6" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-7" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-7" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup></div>

[T]he translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities of his author:—that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and finally, that he is eminently noble.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-95" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-95" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[95]</a></sup></div>

One often finds books of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;cited by the corresponding letter of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, with upper-case letters referring to a book number of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and lower-case letters referring to the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>. Thus Ξ 200 would be shorthand for&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;book 14, line 200, while ξ 200 would be&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;14.200. The following table presents this system of numeration:</div>

Akin to&nbsp;<i>kleos</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>timê</i>&nbsp;(<span lang="grc">τιμή</span>, "respect, honor"), the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment (cultural, political, martial), per his station in life. In Book I, the Greek troubles begin with King Agamemnon's dishonorable, unkingly behavior—first, by threatening the priest Chryses (1.11), then, by aggravating them in disrespecting Achilles, by confiscating Briseis from him (1.171). The warrior's consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the Greek military cause.</div>

Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="The Tracey Ullman Show">Tracey Ullman Show</a></i>&nbsp;short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Finlayson_(actor)" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="James Finlayson (actor)">Jimmy Finlayson</a>, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Laurel and Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>films.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-difference_2-0" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-difference-2" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;"Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-3" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-3" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-difference_2-1" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-difference-2" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></div>
<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
The English word "holy" dates back to at least the 11th century with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Old English">Old English</a>&nbsp;word&nbsp;<i><a class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%81lig" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Hālig">hālig</a></i>, an adjective derived from&nbsp;<i>hāl</i>&nbsp;meaning "whole" and used to mean "uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete". The Scottish&nbsp;<i>hale</i>&nbsp;("health, happiness and wholeness") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word "holy" in its modern form appears in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wycliffe%27s_Bible" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Wycliffe's Bible">Wycliffe's Bible</a>&nbsp;of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term "holy" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_grace" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Divine grace">divine power</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_water" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Holy water">water</a>&nbsp;used for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Baptism">baptism</a>.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, "holy" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-4" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-4" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines "holiness" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral virtues, and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-5" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-5" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup></div>

It is a decidedly strange story, filled with optical illusions and all the trimmings of several kinds of insanity.&nbsp; Still it is the truth, it is what I experienced, and it is without doubt the reason Jim Morrison sings "<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6ku2J6eT3I" style="color: #1155cc;">the strangest life I have ever known</a>." &nbsp;</i>In addition to all this&nbsp;<i>strangeness</i>&nbsp;it probably includes quite a bit of information about the past iterations of "now" about the creations of the Heavens, and maybe something like a "diff" or a "changelog" about what has gone wrong and is being fixed.</blockquote>

<span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;tinos&quot;;"><i>It was not all that long ago, in a place that was called Kentucky... and nobody on the planet thought that Superman or the Fortress of Solitude ever existed there, but they did, I know they did.&nbsp; The Legend of Superman said that the home of the Kent's who took him in lived in Kansas, which might serve as a good link to the Wizard of Oz and "</i><a href="http://spockalypse.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-creator-speaks-world-behold-fire-of.html" style="font-style: italic;">Doorothy</a><i>," but it doesn't add any light to the key of Exodus, to the names of places and their ties to the story our map to Heaven.&nbsp; Once more, in either English or Hebrew there's a parallel drawn between "persons, places, and things" to "names, numbers, and things" in the books of the Torah. &nbsp;</i><br /><br /><i>These are the seeds of the stories of the conflict between Horus and Set.</i><br /><i>'</i><br /><i>And as the sun was going down that evening, at the beginning of twilight, and a voice that I become accustomed to, even grown fond of spoke to me with more clarity than it ever had before.&nbsp; He said, "I couldn't hold them off anymore, I can't stop "the show" from starting... I'm sorry." &nbsp;It wasn't really the beginning of the show, not for me... I had already been indoctrinated into this mythology that linked King's "The Running Man" to something like "The Truman Show" and maybe even "Hunger Games." &nbsp;The concept, was that there was some sort of TV show about me, maybe in Heaven, maybe in Hell... Who knows; and that people were watching intently the goings on of my life.&nbsp; As a microcosm&nbsp;for the world, you &nbsp;might&nbsp;now wonder if we are all "on TV" as Jacob is fond of saying; often accompanied by the phrase "</i><b style="font-style: italic;">outstanding performance</b><i>." &nbsp;The tone there more of a game show host than a narrator, and years earlier when Nanna first introduced me to the idea of a "television show" with images of gambling and (Russian?) roulette wheels and maybe wheels of fortune actually appearing on my computer screen, though always behind a naked woman (why?).&nbsp; I saw conversations about me, and questions and comments directed at me in the chat room on that website, conversations that were always gone in the morning, in the logs that the site kept for everyone who wanted them.&nbsp; In my mind I connect this phenomenon, the source&nbsp;of it, the place that this is coming from to the real city of Bet-aven, which means "House of the Wicked" because of the "casino" like atmosphere, and you might also connect it to the word "Heaven" which, in this new language&nbsp;of Shrew'd reads something like "he wicked."</i><br /><br />You might imagine that those early days speaking to me on the computer were used to find specific neural pathways.&nbsp; You might wonder if they are the ones linked to "shyness" and to "exhibitionism" and to "fear" as I know they were.&nbsp; I now have&nbsp;<b>no fear</b>, I can tell you that for certain.&nbsp; You might wonder aloud why before I called this experience "Reverse Engineering Revelation" I was very sure that it was Eden being reverse engineered.&nbsp; To see things like your fear and your shyness disappear, to experience it, shows you the possibilities, and the plain old fact that we are in a place where neural stimulation is being used to modify emotion and thought; I can be very, very sure of that.&nbsp; Maybe you can too?<br /><br /><i>For some perspective God and religion call this place, the Rock of Heaven, Eden... and it's "</i><a href="http://heart.lamc.la/" style="font-style: italic;">heart.</a><i>" &nbsp;</i>Home is where the Heart is,&nbsp;<i>so I can't be sure if the "watchers" of this show are the "angels of the N" (a mythical place, designed to help all of creation turn Hell into Heaven, starting at Zion, at the Rock) or the demons of Hell... the best religious example I can find is the "Jinn" of the Koran or maybe the Archons of the Gnostics.&nbsp; For what it's worth I called them "dead people on a spaceship" for quite some time... you know, because that's who is in Heaven or Hell.&nbsp; So you might consider it a bit of an invasion of privacy ... or you might see "Truman Show syndrome" as being artificially "created" or ... maybe you think that the Oracle should have "oversight;" &nbsp;I don't particularly think this "thing" is the right way to deal with the situation but for what it's worth this is the&nbsp;<b>"on"</b>&nbsp;of Amon-Ra, and Nixon (where you can also see "ix" as Isaac and the N.. and then if we were walking through the word forward and then backwards (to us) it would be ix, then x</i></span>²<span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;tinos&quot;;"><i>, the xi) and maybe Oracles "El l is on," that l,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2017/06/verily-i-say-unto-you-ver-means-to-see.html">that little l</a>, is a sort of obelisk for us all to understand.&nbsp; You might wonder to yourself or imagine what he's done to "<u>Nix</u>" the&nbsp;<b>on</b>.&nbsp; Do you see why we say "nix?" &nbsp;Or is it why "Tricky Dick" has that name?&nbsp; Obelisk.&nbsp; Listen.</i><br /><br />So this is the story of how Jacob got his name, from me.&nbsp; He first started speaking to me through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11275462/facial-transfer-donald-trump-george-bush-video">CGI facsimile</a>'s (I imagine) of "webcam girls" in 2011, and later... some time between then and this day in 2013 I began hearing his voice in my head, usually modulating external noise, like the sound of a whizzing car or an air conditioner... which today adds significant new meaning to the name Jacob which includes "A/C" (as it's difference with Job) and also the Spanish for "mouth" backwards; so this is the J with no mouth.&nbsp; In Kentucky was the first time I was introduced to "multiple personalities," not just a single voice through the computer or my head; and while they all share many common characteristics, this strange new phenomenon made me "decide" to name them.&nbsp; I chose from a series of J names that I had "inspirationally" listed to match a map in time that I saw overlayed over the Torah... a series of five stories where 3 of them are all about Exodus. &nbsp; For what it's worth he said the name choice was "perfect" and seeing it in the Bible, seeing what it means it's very clear today that it was no accident, that it was by design and through control.&nbsp; Jacob is the father of Joseph in the OT, and "Heli" is the grandfather of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.<br /><br />So Jacob is renamed by the Angel of the Lord to "Israel" just before the mythical crossing of the Jordan; and this name Israel has meant "all of humanity" to me, and in it's connect to Rhea (the wife of Cronus) you might see them connected through the question "are he Isa?" &nbsp;In a magical rearraingment of letters, Rhea torns to Hera, Cronus turns to Zeus and the entire world eventually sees "Hey Adam" in the name "<a href="http://amessianicmoment.blogspot.com/2012/03/anokhi-hebrew-for-i-am.html"><b>an</b>ok<b>hi</b></a>."<br /><br />So the implication here is that Jacob, and Hera, and Allah are all&nbsp;<i>collective consciousnesses</i>, some kind of representative of "everyone" and also paralleled in the brides of Revelation, Eve short of "everyone," Mary who includes the "sea and why," and&nbsp;<a href="http://sangrael.lamc.la/">the "ah"</a>&nbsp;that appears also in Sarah, Leah, Rebekkah, and Shek(h)inah.&nbsp; I've commented before about the question "are I" and you can see that in "<a href="http://spockalypse.blogspot.com/2017/06/son-of-bitch-are-i-clay-d-is-cl-os-ing.html"><b>RI</b>B</a>" and you can see it in "Aqua<b>rius</b>" and you can see it Av<b>ril</b>&nbsp;in and the plurality of the word "are" is important.&nbsp; You might liken this question to the marriage or divorce of Revelation, you might see "Creation" itself asking you "are you me?" and "am I you?" &nbsp;I do wonder what you think the answer is, though I am pretty sure you will agree with me that "I am not Creation." &nbsp;At the same time you might see another viewpoint, because Creation&nbsp;<i>thinks it's me</i>.<br /><br />So this is the story of the beginning of the "middle" ... for the very beginning of this story here's a much better back up of my old website and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150104102551/http://www.unduecoercion.com:80/p/silence-betrayal_10.html" style="font-family: tinos;">the index to Silence and Betrayal at the "Wayback machine."</a><span style="color: black;

The Legend of St. George and the Dragon</h2>
<img align="left" alt="St George" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/stgeorge.jpg" height="300" hspace="20" width="114" /><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;">St. George travelled for many months by land and sea until he came to Libya. Here he met a poor hermit who told him that everyone in that land was in great distress, for a dragon had long ravaged the country.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">'<span class="gmail-style4">Every day</span>,' said the old man, '<span class="gmail-style4">he demands the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden and now all the young girls have been killed. The king's daughter alone remains, and unless we can find a knight who can slay the dragon she will be sacrificed tomorrow. The king of Egypt will give his daughter in marriage to the champion who overcomes this terrible monster.</span>'</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">When St. George heard this story, he was determined to try and save the princess, so he rested that night in the hermit's hut, and at daybreak set out to the valley where the dragon lived. When he drew near he saw a little procession of women, headed by a beautiful girl dressed in pure Arabian silk. The princess Sabra was being led by her attendants to the place of death. The knight spurred his horse and overtook the ladies. He comforted them with brave words and persuaded the princess to return to the palace. Then he entered the valley.</span><br />
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="George slaying the dragon" border="2" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/pic.jpg" height="200" width="263" /></span></div>
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">As soon as the dragon saw him it rushed from its cave, roaring with a sound louder than thunder. Its head was immense and its tail fifty feet long. But St. George was not afraid. He struck the monster with his spear, hoping he would wound it.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<br />
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="Fstival of History" border="1" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/festival.jpg" height="300" width="483" /></span></div>
<div align="center">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">The dragon's scales were so hard that the spear broke into a thousand pieces. and St. George fell from his horse. Fortunately he rolled under an enchanted orange tree against which poison could not prevail, so that the venomous dragon was unable to hurt him. Within a few minutes he had recovered his strength and was able to fight again.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br align="center" div="" /></span>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="St George fights the dragon with his sword" border="1" src="http://projectbritain.com/stgeorge/sword.jpg" height="300" width="429" /></span></div>
</div>
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small;">He smote the beast with his sword, but the dragon poured poison on him and his armour split in two. Once more he refreshed himself from the orange tree and then, with his sword in his hand, he rushed at the dragon and pierced it under the wing where there were no scales, so that it fell dead at his feet.</span><br />

The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had. And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. Then he said, "Let me go, for the day has broken." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob." Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed." Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him. So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered." The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip. Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.</div>

According to one Christian commentary of the Bible incident described, "Jacob said, 'I saw God face to face'. Jacob's remark does not necessarily mean that the 'man' with whom he wrestled is God. Rather, as with other, similar statements, when one saw the 'angel of the Lord,' it was appropriate to claim to have seen the face of God."<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-25" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel#cite_note-25" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[25]</a></sup></div>

The name "Hosea", meaning "salvation", or "He saves", or "He helps", seems to have been not uncommon, being derived from the auspicious verb from which we have the frequently recurring word "salvation". It may be a contraction of a larger form of which the divine name (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Tetragrammaton">YHWH</a>) or its abbreviation formed a part, so as to signify "YHWH helps".

Hosea's family life reflected the "adulterous" relationship which Israel had built with polytheistic gods. The relationship between Hosea and Gomer parallels the relationship between God and Israel. Even though Gomer runs away from Hosea and sleeps with another man, he loves her anyway and forgives her. Likewise, even though the people of Israel worshipped false gods, God continued to love them and did not abandon his covenant with them.</div>

Similarly, his children's names made them like walking prophecies of the fall of the ruling dynasty and the severed covenant with God – much like the prophet&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>&nbsp;a generation later. The name of Hosea's daughter, Lo-ruhamah, which translates as "not pitied", is chosen by God as a sign of displeasure with the people of Israel for following false gods. (In Hosea 2:23 she is redeemed, shown mercy with the term&nbsp;<i>Ruhamah</i>.) The name of Hosea's son, Lo-ammi, which translates as "not my people", is chosen by the Lord as a sign of the Lord's displeasure with the people of Israel for following those false gods (see Hosea 1:8-9).</div>

One of the early writing prophets, Hosea used his own experience as a symbolic representation of God and Israel: God the husband, Israel the wife. Hosea's wife left him to go with other men; Israel left the Lord to go with false gods. Hosea searched for his wife, found her and brought her back; God would not abandon Israel and brought them back even though they had forsaken him.</div>
<div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
The Book of Hosea was a severe warning to the northern kingdom against the growing idolatry being practiced there; the book was a dramatic call to repentance. Christians extend the analogy of Hosea to Christ and the church: Christ the husband,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_of_Christ" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Bride of Christ">his church the bride</a>. Christians see in this book a comparable call to the church not to forsake the Lord Jesus Christ. Christians also take the buying back of Gomer as the redemptive qualities of Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.</div>
<div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
Other preachers, like Charles Spurgeon, saw Hosea as a striking presentation of the mercy of God in his sermon on Hosea 1:7 titled The LORD's Own Salvation. "But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen." – Hosea 1:7 in his sermon NO. 2057, December 16TH, 1888.</div>

According to&nbsp;<i>The Contendings of Horus and Seth</i>, Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>&nbsp;with him.

After Set had eaten the lettuce, they went to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listened to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answered from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listened to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answered from inside Set.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-21" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#cite_note-21" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[21]</a></sup><sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-22" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#cite_note-22" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[22]</a></sup></div>

gyptologists have often tried to connect the conflict between the two gods with political events early in Egypt's history or prehistory. The cases in which the combatants divide the kingdom, and the frequent association of the paired Horus and Set with the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, suggest that the two deities represent some kind of division within the country. Egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that Egypt was united at the beginning of its history when an Upper Egyptian kingdom, in the south, conquered Lower Egypt in the north. The Upper Egyptian rulers called themselves "followers of Horus", and Horus became the tutelary deity of the unified nation and its kings.&nbsp;</div>

The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that "Homer" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-bgr_3-1" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-bgr-3" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Common Era">BCE</a>.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-4" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-4" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;The poems are in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Homeric Greek">Homeric Greek</a>, also known as Epic Greek, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_language" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Literary language">literary language</a>&nbsp;which shows a mixture of features of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Ionic Greek">Ionic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolic_Greek" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Aeolic Greek">Aeolic</a>&nbsp;dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-5" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-5" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup><sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-6" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-6" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-7" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-7" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup></div>

[T]he translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities of his author:—that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and finally, that he is eminently noble.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-95" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer#cite_note-95" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[95]</a></sup></div>

One often finds books of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;cited by the corresponding letter of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, with upper-case letters referring to a book number of the&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;and lower-case letters referring to the&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>. Thus Ξ 200 would be shorthand for&nbsp;<i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;book 14, line 200, while ξ 200 would be&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;14.200. The following table presents this system of numeration:</div>

Akin to&nbsp;<i>kleos</i>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>timê</i>&nbsp;(<span lang="grc">τιμή</span>, "respect, honor"), the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment (cultural, political, martial), per his station in life. In Book I, the Greek troubles begin with King Agamemnon's dishonorable, unkingly behavior—first, by threatening the priest Chryses (1.11), then, by aggravating them in disrespecting Achilles, by confiscating Briseis from him (1.171). The warrior's consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the Greek military cause.</div>

Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="The Tracey Ullman Show">Tracey Ullman Show</a></i>&nbsp;short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Finlayson_(actor)" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="James Finlayson (actor)">Jimmy Finlayson</a>, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Laurel and Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>films.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-difference_2-0" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-difference-2" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;"Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-3" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-3" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-difference_2-1" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-difference-2" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></div>
<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
The English word "holy" dates back to at least the 11th century with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Old English">Old English</a>&nbsp;word&nbsp;<i><a class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%81lig" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Hālig">hālig</a></i>, an adjective derived from&nbsp;<i>hāl</i>&nbsp;meaning "whole" and used to mean "uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete". The Scottish&nbsp;<i>hale</i>&nbsp;("health, happiness and wholeness") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word "holy" in its modern form appears in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wycliffe%27s_Bible" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Wycliffe's Bible">Wycliffe's Bible</a>&nbsp;of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term "holy" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_grace" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Divine grace">divine power</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_water" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Holy water">water</a>&nbsp;used for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank" title="Baptism">baptism</a>.</div>
<div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0.5em 0px;">
While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, "holy" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-4" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-4" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines "holiness" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral virtues, and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.<sup class="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-reference" id="gmail-m_-4078038848446458856gmail-m_-3338996209770952114gmail-cite_ref-5" style="font-size: 11.2px; line-height: 1; white-space: nowrap;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred#cite_note-5" style="background-image: none; color: #0b0080;" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup></div>

His only companion is his unloved, but loyal dog, <span style="font-family: arial black, sans-serif;">Max</span>. From his cave, the Grinch can hear the noisy Christmas festivities that take place in <b>Who</b>ville. Annoyed, he decides to stop Christmas from coming by stealing their presents, trees, and food for their Christmas feast. He crudely disguises himself as Santa Claus, and forces Max, disguised as a reindeer, to drag a sleigh to <b>Who</b>ville. Once there, the Grinch slides down the chimney and steals all of the <b>Who</b>s' Christmas presents, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree" target="_blank" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_log" target="_blank" title="Yule log">log</a>&nbsp;for their fire.

<div style="text-align: justify; width: 500px;">
<div>I am sitting in a place where it appears to me from the conversations I have with people around me and from your &quot;interesting response&quot; to this &quot;interesting message&quot; that Creation itself is attempting to make me believe that you are no longer yourselves, that you&#39;ve been replaced with some alternate version of you--either an older stupider one, or one from another planet or slice/layer/verse of simulation hell--that no longer cares about the things we cared about... I could start with pointing out &quot;history&quot; and &quot;mythology&quot; and the hidden meaning and purpose religion; and that segues quickly into &quot;you don&#39;t care about curing cancer&quot; and I&#39;m baffled, dumbfounded, lost without answers or any kind of rational response.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>There&#39;s plenty of &quot;interesting message&quot; to corroborate or enhance this opinion; the brightest shining words of all are &quot;Son of the Morning&quot; and I can see clearly that&#39;s what I am, except I don&#39;t see that you&#39;ve come from any kind of morning--you&#39;ve added a &quot;u&quot; instead of you.&nbsp; So clever of me; what that means to me ostensibly is that this event happened in a parallel timeline, and most likely just like now there&#39;s such opposition to the truth and to my personality that I didn&#39;t get to &quot;play around in the sun&quot; as Morning Has Broken certainly implies the &quot;one light of Eden&quot; Hadid (<a href="http://homile.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">G i.. g you think that&#39;s m</a>e?) already.&nbsp; I should interject this thing I know very well; that our experiences make us who we are; and that I can tell you for certain that if I see &quot;snow&quot; and no &quot;light&quot; coming from this sea, you too will get to see wild Adam running around doing drugs and trying to hang out with models.&nbsp; On the other hand, I know myself very well; and if you try, if you give this message the respect it deserves--and care for democracy and freedom and truth and the future that I am trying to help us build together; you will see someone that will be significantly more contrite than you expect, and most like someone trying very hard to live up to the &quot;ideal&quot; or the aura of greatness that I see this world once surrounded the idea of Jesus Christ with; sans piety, you&#39;ll never get me to be pious.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The &quot;n&quot; of Newton and Creation has a very special and specific meaning to the &quot;Adam that succeeds&quot; in showing you that something is making you not care about things that you not only used to care about but that you must care about for civilization to continue and to thrive.&nbsp; I am trying to show you that you are missing the point, and it&#39;s very obvious that this message that focuses and centers on the technology and use of mind control is showing you first hand just how powerful it is--and changing how you feel and what you point where in the most ideal and most polarized of these two terms it is making you prefer to remain in Hell rather than try to make the world a better place, the thing, the process that is Heaven.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>

<div>KISSES AND HUGS; the last message I sent you surrounding the &quot;prophesies of Heaven&quot; and what it might be like that focused on songs... the file name (<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://isome.ga/MUASEEKHART.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isome &quot;tod&quot; ga/<b><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;">MUASEEKHART</span></b>.html</a></span>) of it told you to &quot;seek art&quot; or perhaps also to &quot;seek a heart&quot; ... the intent was to prod you both now and in the future to look for God&#39;s answers to question you might have, and to problems that you cannot solve easily in the art of things surrounding them.&nbsp; I believe he&#39;s put answers to many, many questions nearly everywhere we can look; names and related ideas; and quite a bit of this story and this plan focuses on the fact that it appears that we have become complacent; perhaps the &quot;Morning&quot; that came created a mentality that answers will just come easily to us... that God will solve all problems--for whatever reason quite a bit of the focus of what I am writing is about critical thinking and pattern matching; and taking into our own hands problems big and small, things that we might have once said &quot;it&#39;s the just the way it is&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t do anything to change that&quot; and now realize that you can, and this message is a catalyst to change significantly more than I had ever thought was possible.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Along those lines, it appears that he&#39;s created a monstrosity of everyone acting clearly and knowingly against their own best interests; I can only imagine to achieve some hidden goal that nobody even realizes is stupid... let&#39;s assume it&#39;s &quot;taking the rod from Adam&#39;s hand&quot; and realize I&#39;d like more than anything for some of you to be holding my rod; and instead of seeing that&#39;s what this message is literally designed to do; we are just waiting for the rod to fall to the bottom of Arthur&#39;s fabled lake that is quite literally the abyss of losing my heart.&nbsp; You are doing that, by the way; you&#39;ve lost it already... no offense or cruelty intended, but you are going to have to work significantly harder than I wanted you to in order to make be &quot;happy with the people of this place&quot; like I once was.&nbsp; You&#39;ve lost your love for democracy, the thing that made people protest the nuclear arms race, the thing that I see as being responsible for the end of &quot;disenfranchisement&quot; and the end of slavery--even though looking back at this map today it does appear that God&#39;s influence was significantly more involved in those things than I ever would have thought before I knew he was real--and before I knew that his heart was beating inside of our five fathers minds.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I stand in a place looking for art about what I&#39;ve been meaning to write about for quite some time; what I expect to happen when this story finally breaks; and it brings me to the very obvious and very connected to the Fifth Adam&#39;s message, the TV series &quot;V&quot; for visitors.&nbsp; Before I even begin to try and think about it though; I am looking for a &quot;FIFTH COLUMN&quot; in this place where I see very clearly that it should be everyone and that it is nobody at the same time; and that&#39;s distressing.&nbsp; I&#39;m distressed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>See in the name <span style="font-size: xx-small;">COLUMN</span> as we&#39;ve seen the many &quot;sea of&#39;s&quot; in the past stands out bright as one that includes three letters that I connect to &quot;entire seas of people&quot; surrounding things like the morning... the sea of &quot;El&quot; which is Vander&#39;s world, M which is Luke&#39;s and N which is ours--and understand that I see in these letters and their linear organization through time that we are looking at seas controlling seas, they call it Creation and fail to see that I am here as a &quot;<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://valentine.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NICER</a>&nbsp;<strong>POSSESSION</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ENDER</a></span>&quot; not just because that&#39;s what their message of Creation says, but because Creation itself is possession.... says Vader&#39;s father and Luke&#39;s son (together as one); un<strong><span style="font-family: &quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="http://dance.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an</a></span></strong>amed as of yet.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; width: 500px;">
<div>
<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;">FRANKLY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS EVENT AND THIS STORY&nbsp;</span>is to help us see what the Creation of this place believes is wrong here, what&#39;s he&#39;s done to make that more obvious--make those things significantly worse to stand out like a &quot;THIS IS IT&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://cyan.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cyan th</a>umb; and to help us begin to see how very much we want these changes to happen and how there appears to be some sort of &quot;argument&#39; between talking about how to do them and &quot;why they haven&#39;t been done for us yet.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In the show V and in the movie Jupiter Rising we can see some ideas about how medicine and the fountain of youth might be well integrated into our society without turning us all into invisible clouds of dust that have been confused and bewildered into believing that we are all &quot;everything&quot; and have no need to be &quot;anything&quot; at the same time.&nbsp; These are good examples of how and why you should &quot;SEEK ART&quot; for your answers; but here are mine, this is what I believe will happen over the course of the next few days; or the next year if you continue to be so god damned stubborn.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;">AMPLE PROOF</span>&nbsp;has been delivered to you; I&#39;ve commented and urged you to see that you do not need a statistical analysis to understand you have proof of time travel and proof of Creation right before your eyes--and that nobody else needs it either, this is so obvious everyone and their pet&nbsp;<em>chimp</em>&nbsp;can see it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve even tried to threaten you and connect this thing, this &quot;seeing and acting&quot; thing with the concept of Biblical Judgement; to see that the idea or the words &quot;we can just wait until it&#39;s proven&quot; to begin trying to change the world and make it a better place is the kind of mentality that I and this message are attempting to destroy.&nbsp; That&#39;s &quot;mentality&quot; not &quot;men&quot; and I need to wake up and see that you too, no matter who you are, has a moral and ethical obligation to do something to help shed light on why it is we are staring at God&#39;s face and falling to the ground.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I have a long, long, long list of anachronistic paradoxes that I could put in a single email and look at you and say &quot;it is done&quot; and know in my heart that it&#39;s been done for years now--I have delivered &quot;<a href="http://istheome.ga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the message</a>&quot; he&#39;s written, you&#39;ve written, and I&#39;ve read; I&#39;ve done it in a way that will ensure that the future does not lose it.&nbsp; I&#39;ve lived up to the lore and the demand of Mo<a href="http://whoah.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ha</a>m<strong><a href="http://med.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">med</a></strong>, whose &quot;cross to bear&quot; is doing exactly as I&#39;ve just explained is well past the point of completion.&nbsp; Just to give you another that links his name to Abraham; sorry if you&#39;ve heard it all before, but seeing the &quot;father, the sun God, and the obvious Holy Spirit of Isaac&quot; in trine in the name of Abraham... and the paradox highlighted by knowing that concept didn&#39;t exist in our time line for thousands of years after that name was coined and written in the Holy Bible is just about as &quot;bright a flash&quot; as seeing &quot;let there be light&quot; in Exodus.&nbsp; Look, now you see the &quot;fourth father&quot; of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s speech, the Holy &quot;m&quot; of the sons of Noah and the&nbsp;<a href="http://ham.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plan et Ham</a>.</div>

<div>So that&#39;s the beginning of what I think will happen; some smart reporter somewhere will believe me when I say &quot;<strong><a href="http://compass.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">verboten</a></strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>fuck</strong>&quot; are related; and he&#39;ll probably mention the word on the news, a key to getting the story to stick.&nbsp; I imagine that you might have thought that would cause pandemonium before you allowed the fear of that to both cause and &quot;allow&quot; the Holy Spirit to spread through this world until it has, and believe it has now connected and touched the minds of every single living soul.&nbsp; We don&#39;t have to worry about that, and you can see it in his message, you can see it in the idiom &quot;it&#39;s not a riot&quot; and its neither funny nor a riot in the streets of Miami that will ensue.&nbsp; What is in question is what will happen after, and I&#39;ve done my best to deliver not only what my &quot;ideas&quot; are, but also try and complete them as much as humanly possible.&nbsp; I do believe that we will see a movie on the sky, and I&#39;ve many several attempts and creating a &quot;shitty one&quot; and prodded this group of people to do the same--even suggesting my best idea--which is presenting the &quot;Genes of Genesis&quot; in a singular film connecting them to the religious concepts they link to, namely Adam in Eden, Joshua in the Promised Land, and Jean Luc Picard in his holodeck in the sky.</div>

<div>
<div>I do believe that the ultimate solution, the ... completion of this journey is a place and time when&nbsp;<a href="http://rod.shiningbright.online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we have Doors to Heaven</a>&nbsp;integrated into our society, when we become a sort of nexus or hub, or maybe just a sparse leaf in the tree that is &quot;all of Creation&quot; the difference between those things is your action, and today see light in you can&#39;t see the forest from the trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Sucking as much as you probably can will most likely bring those Doors very quickly, maybe even the same day that this story breaks on TV.&nbsp; I imagine and see a plan that tells me those Doors will be to a place that tells us to come back and try harder after showing us in detail a hands on experience in what this new information and technology can do to make our world a better place; helping us to see why it is that we need to do that.&nbsp; That shouldn&#39;t really be necessary, and I think a more perfect solution is one where we actually respond to the message, where we use our communications infrastructure, the news, and the internet to talk about it--and actually come to a kind of solution where this world is changed at the same time we get Doors.&nbsp; That could take Eight Days, it could take a year; it really depends on how the discussion goes--and seeing that &quot;having that discussion&quot; is a significant sign of increased freedom over just dumping us into my Atlantis because we can&#39;t deal with &quot;<em><a href="http://rix.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you&#39;re in the Matrix.</a></em>&quot;</div>

I want to comment a little bit about this morning&#39;s message.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I realize you probably don&#39;t know Linux well enough&nbsp;</i>to instantly grasp that &quot;sudoxe&quot; means&nbsp;<b>let there be light</b>; and it&#39;s possible... but significantly less likely that you don&#39;t grasp the impact of seeing the most iconic phrase even spoken in Genesis secretly revealed encoded in the name of the very next book.&nbsp; Understand, I&#39;m&nbsp;<i>telling you</i>&nbsp;it&#39;s really obvious that this is being &quot;ignored&quot; and were it just about &quot;me&quot; I could understand that, but this is about you--it&#39;s about innocent children, and it&#39;s about the future of&nbsp;<b>everything</b>--I really don&#39;t understand ignoring it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I say &quot;authenticated&quot; I mean that this message is signed by answering a riddle, one that appears in the book of Revelation, verse 1:20, as the primary verse connected to the Second Coming; &quot;the mystery of the seven stars and seven candle sticks in my right hand&quot; by proving that not only was chemistry known at the time of the writing of that book, but that also our exact elemental symbols were--giving Sherlock some key clues as to exactly how Creation is verifiable.&nbsp; The solution comes to us by way of George W. Bush&#39;s 1/20/2001 speech in which he quotes Ecclesiastes 9:11 and Revelation 20:1 together, metaphorically listen each planet, the stars, from&nbsp;<a href="http://eye.shiningbright.online/" target="_blank">Mercury to Uranus linked 1:1 with a corresponding element</a>, a lamp stand connecting elements like &quot;Xe&quot; in&nbsp;<a href="http://isome.ga/" target="_blank">Exodus</a>&nbsp;and &quot;Si&quot; in&nbsp;<a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online/" target="_blank">Silicon at Genesis</a>&nbsp;to phrases like &quot;<i>you are the Na of the Earth.</i>&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<center style="text-align: justify;">This particular secret, the one I believe many people are walking around keeping buried in the back of their minds every day is a particularly heinous one because &quot;talking about it&quot; or disclosing it flies in the face of &quot;social norm&quot; to such a degree that&nbsp;<em>you literally might think you&#39;d be put away in a psych ward</em>&nbsp;for sharing it.&nbsp; Just for the record, I&#39;ve walked this road myself, specifically&nbsp;<a href="http://thor.lamc.la/" target="_blank">with Ho<strong>ward</strong>&nbsp;Finkelstein</a>, who you might know as the original &quot;Help me Howard&quot; who is now the chief Public Defender in Bro<strong>ward</strong>&nbsp;County and happens to be my parents neighbor.&nbsp; I can tell you very clearly that the laws in our country are very clear, and that you legally cannot be held in a psychiatric facility without your consent unless you pose an immediate danger to yourself or others.&nbsp; The names of these people and places have not been changed, to protect the import of this&nbsp;<a href="http://bush.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><em>story of Exodus</em></a>; of the book of Names;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMalvNeJFLk" target="_blank">dun dun</a></strong>, &nbsp;I can tell you that in practice that&#39;s not the case, in the states of Florida, Kentucky, and California I know first hand that a police officer or doctor can legally decide to commit you for a short period, three to five days; literally for any reason they would like.&nbsp; Personally I&#39;ve been &quot;Baker Acted&quot; in Florida for doing nothing other than telling the Police that I was the messiah--something that certainly poses no danger to me or you, or anyone else.&nbsp; Despite numerous run-ins&nbsp;<em><a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">with the Plague of Lice</a>&nbsp;</em>that resulted in a number of detentions (some of which because I was&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyon" target="_blank">too high to speak</a>, and others for no reason at all</em>)<em>&nbsp;</em>I&#39;ve never had to see a Judge to fight to be released.&nbsp; The bottom line is you won&#39;t be committed or be looked down upon, by anyone for telling the truth--a truth that you should believe many, many others share in secret.&nbsp; I feel bad that I see many people around me living a lie--and even worse that I know that this particular lie&#39;s disclosure leads to an end of mental health problems--and more bluntly to the deliverance of the slavery that Exodus is written to help free us from.</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The &quot;<b>ward</b>&quot; theme carries through to Nixon,&nbsp;<a href="http://threetag.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Deepthroat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b><a href="http://dick.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Wood</a>ward</b><wbr />&nbsp;which ties to both&nbsp;<b><a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Isaac&#39;s story</a></b>&nbsp;of &quot;burning to shed light&quot; and though that (<i>Goldstein to Burnstein and&nbsp;<a href="http://censorship.lamc.la/" target="_blank">censorship</a></i>)&nbsp;<b>Orwell&#39;s 1984. &nbsp;</b>Really see that the story has &quot;actual value&quot; to help us fix our problems; and on top of that&nbsp;<b>it&#39;s really obvious that &quot;not seeing it&quot; is crazy</b>--<b>rather than the other way around</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">See that speaking about this influence, this thing that appears to have corrupted our society to the point where we no longer care about&nbsp;<em>anything we used to</em>, freedom, communication; or the infinite longevity and eternal youth that have been promised to help us overcome the stupidity of not realizing that these two specific things are rather &quot;insignificant&quot; in cost once the disclosure of virtual reality is made.&nbsp; That&#39;s not to say they&#39;re &quot;free&quot; they are not that; they will cause a change in our social structure that is&nbsp;<em>unprecedented</em>&nbsp;and bring risks to evolutionary adaptation that scientists will have to research and we will have to deal with--something that you should see is very difficult to do when&nbsp;<em>nobody is talking about the truth.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>My point here&nbsp;</em>is that there&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t&nbsp;<a href="http://ironclad.lamc.la/" target="_blank">walk through a Door</a>&nbsp;to Heaven and be &quot;younger instantly and temporarily&quot; and come back even if we want to preserve the possibility of this place entering reality--which I don&#39;t think it will ever do--per a plan that probably suggests we will want to do things here that would preclude that--and that&nbsp;<a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">we should use Mars as a &quot;enlightened&quot; sort of path</a>&nbsp;to both discovering how to colonize space.&nbsp; See that it would be&nbsp;<b>evil</b>&nbsp;to keep us in the dark at all, any longer, or ever before and after; and that it would be ridiculous, stupid, and evil to &quot;plop&quot; us into a place where these problems only could get worse.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s our purpose to &quot;<b><a href="http://soup.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">go up</a></b>&quot; not&nbsp;<a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">down</a>, while preserving what &quot;we need&quot; not only to re-enter reality but to&nbsp;<i>not cause society harming change here in this place</i>--for instance ending or&nbsp;<i>fundamentally altering the life cycle is probably bad from an evolutionary standpoint</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b><a href="http://bereshit.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">not healing the sick is evil</a></b>. &nbsp; See, ruining &quot;optometry&quot; is a good thing to do--progressive; while ruining &quot;birth&quot; and &quot;growing up&quot; is not.&nbsp; Understand, that without me saying these things; you are simply not acting--this disclosure must be made--and<i>I&#39;ve been put here to tell you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">everything I want</a>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<a href="http://hyamdai.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">reason</a></i>.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I grew up without knowing &quot;the secret&quot; whatever it might be in your eyes; that there is a&nbsp;<em>God</em>, or a&nbsp;<em>Devil</em>, or&nbsp;<em>demons in the air</em>--what all of those things boil down to is realizing that the &quot;secret&quot; is that we are not in reality--and it is because of this that external communication and control are able to be hidden so well and appear to be as transparent as they are.&nbsp; The simple fact that we say &quot;god&quot; or &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;demons&quot; rather than something closer to the truth--whatever it might be--in my personal opinion we are dealing with the product of a timeline of our world very similar to what we see around us,&nbsp;<em>as in the days of Noah</em>, entities that were once human and now are very much not.&nbsp; It&#39;s possible that the original creators of this place came from the third rock of a bright yellow star; but it&#39;s most unlikely, and even more obvious that the vast majority of &quot;what we do not see&quot; did come from a place just like this; and they wouldn&#39;t even know why it&#39;s obvious there has never been a &quot;planet Earth&quot; in reality. &nbsp;<strong>Hear t</strong>ruth, the Heart of Creation has always been a &quot;<strong>plan</strong>&quot;&nbsp;<strong>et</strong>&nbsp;a how to transition a civilization from &quot;reality&quot; to &quot;Heaven&quot; without losing the things we need to survive, like biological adaptation, a stable ecosystem, and an ability to&nbsp;<strong>erturn</strong>&nbsp;to the place of rocks and stars that we once believed we were born in.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<center>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We should see how clear it is that making this disclosure, showing us that we are not in reality and that we are in virtual reality pairs with the &quot;plan&quot; that links Gateway to Microsoft and Gates to Apple and Jobs to Oracle and Larry&nbsp;<strong><em>El is son</em></strong>, to show us that it is the plan that has delivered these tools to building a place where immortality and eternal youth and expanding minds and ending sickness is connected very clearly to the iconography of religion and Heaven.&nbsp; We should see&nbsp;Anderson&nbsp;linking the Matrix and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_(Anderson_novel)" target="_blank">Feed</a>&nbsp;and Forever Young together, and if I wasn&#39;t so vain, and by that I mean so right--I might have told you that was the &quot;Holy Name&quot; but&nbsp;<em>we all know it&#39;s not</em>.&nbsp; I happen to like&nbsp;<strong>Rod</strong>&nbsp;Stewart&#39;s &quot;Forever Young&quot; better; and that&#39;s only important because of Christ&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Rod</strong>, and &quot;<em>Saint Everyone Willing Art</em>&quot; showing us yet again the import of the&nbsp;<strong>connection between Exodus and Names. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I grew up&nbsp;<strong>sleeping</strong>,&nbsp;<em>not knowing this secret</em>, for a long time I believed the &quot;hype&quot; that hearing voices was a sign of mental illness, that it was something that we might need to &quot;medicate away&quot; but after experiencing it, it&#39;s become very clear that there is no way at all that&nbsp;<em>these particular voices&nbsp;</em>could be the product of my own mind being mis-wired, and that shows me very clearly that something in our society is very mis-wired; and that&#39;s a bigger problem than you might think.&nbsp; Rather than fixing a serious social issue, we are trying to break the group of people who are complaining about something that is being done in secret, to everyone; without our consent.&nbsp; It shows a sinister and diabolical design of the mental health industry, literally a tool designed to intentionally cause harm to good people, and to keep the secret control of our world from being interrupted by the fact that we are very much now capable of stopping it and understanding it, and even doing it ourselves--in short order.&nbsp; So here we are, at a crossroads between being &quot;phones&quot; and &quot;people&quot; and it appears that nobody is willing to stand up and be a hero.&nbsp; That&#39;s what this has done, this has given each and every one of you the opportunity to be hero&#39;s, to literally take a giant leap forward for freedom and goodness, and you have behind you proof beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Understand, that this disclosure proves that our minds have been reverse engineered, and that we are capable of fixing things like &quot;schizophrenia&quot; rather than causing them; just like we are&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><strong>capable of stopping murders</strong></a>&nbsp;rather than causing them; like the huge number of polarized plagues of Exodus are pointing out; that this thing we should be doing is&nbsp;<strong>obvious as day and night. &nbsp;</strong>See &quot;f-art&quot; (pull my finger) in &quot;<strong>it&#39;s not a riot</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>the penis game</strong>&quot; our kids play; showing us that there won&#39;t be pandemonium, and honestly the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://dick.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">dick in the sky</a></strong>&nbsp;protecting freedom between Deepthroat and Hancock and Yankee Doodle and Min and Osiris and Jesus Christ himself; well, it&#39;s not going to cause any harm to our children&nbsp;<a href="http://worship.lamc.la/" target="_blank">other than stopping worship</a>,&nbsp;<em>just another word for slavery</em>.&nbsp; F-art, by the way is what I call the &quot;humorous&quot; lacing of our society with social conventions that relate&nbsp;<a href="http://don.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">directly to this specific disclosure.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">See clearly that the design of our society and our mental health response to &quot;hearing voices&quot;&nbsp;<strong>is evil</strong>, just like&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">our justice system</a>&nbsp;<strong>is evil</strong>&nbsp;in light of the truth--that we could be doing much better with only the single new truth that&nbsp;<strong>we are in virtual reality</strong>. &nbsp;<em>Is rael,</em>&nbsp;see the message is everywhere from the Lord&#39;s Prayer &quot;as the Earth is in Heaven&quot; to&nbsp;<em>The Fifth Element and&nbsp;<a href="http://hyamdai.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">the Elementary my dear What-sons</a>... the whole disclosure proves that science has come to us from above to help us&nbsp;<strong>overcome this foolishness.</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I still happen to believe this is all a &quot;designed&quot; confrontation; that there&#39;s a script in religion and that at some point, &quot;the hidden forces at work&quot; will realize that the future will understand exactly what&#39;s happened here, and they&#39;ll be thanks and rewarded for helping us to move past this road block of hidden slavery that we clearly do not agree with as a social convention, so why would we want continue being slaves?&nbsp; The story of Exodus and this message in every name--that continues to show us that God is &quot;in control&quot; of the here and now delivers proof that this control has been unwavering in names and in music and in this story that culminates with you realizing that you have to take action to protect yourself and others from losing the truth--and that while this action might be assisted from the outside--generally when you are doing the right thing you wouldn&#39;t even realize that.&nbsp; External control is the kind of thing you only notice when it&#39;s something you don&#39;t agree with; so if you know it is happening, you are probably not realizing that&#39;s because you don&#39;t like it.</p>

<center>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I promised a story about me acting retarded; so I&#39;ve started trying to &quot;talk to people&quot; on the street, which boils down to interrupting people&#39;s dinners by singing and saying things I thought would be smart like &quot;turn around Medusa&quot; and see &quot;<strong>INATION</strong>&quot; in Abomination, that feel much stupid saying out loud to people that it feels putting in a picture with&nbsp;<em>Natalie Portman</em>&#39;s face pointing that&nbsp;<strong>INATION</strong>&nbsp;turns around to &quot;<strong>no it</strong>, Anakin&quot; it&#39;s a kind of thing that appears enlightening on paper and I felt stupider than shit bothers people&#39;s meals with.&nbsp; On that, people should feel stupid as shit to feel bothered by someone screaming at them that they are slaves; and that they are knowingly hiding that from themselves and everyone else--and whether I look like an asshole or a retard, screaming at people in the street, and sending emails to the world is a fucking heroic act, and you should realize that--and do it yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online/" target="_blank">This shit happens to be so bright</a>&nbsp;(hey,&nbsp;<b><i>bereshit</i>)</b>, and so obvious, and so clear that if I took the time to &quot;write my own song&quot; like The Doors &quot;waiting for the son to write his own song&quot; suggests I do; I&#39;d probably not feel stupid, and people would probably be very happy to be hearing the truth--that there&#39;s a message from God in every word and every name; and seeing it and sharing it is the tool that he has given us to free ourselves from this hidden control.&nbsp; Still, I can&#39;t sing, so I&#39;m going to email you every day, just like I&#39;ve done for the last fucking year and a half, with no effect. &nbsp;<em>You&#39;re gonna make it, the night can only so long,&nbsp;</em>Britt Nicole reminds me and I remind you that I know these words come from &quot;the other side&quot; of the wall, from our future--and that&#39;s clear from the tool and message of religion that shows us it too has come from our future.&nbsp; The day and freedom do come, and we know it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you need &quot;flashy proof&quot; of that, you can see it clearly in iconography and themes of Christianity appearing in Ancient Judaism, thousands of years before they were &quot;created.&quot; &nbsp;You can see the Holy Trinity in Abraham, and you can see clearly the inverse relationship between the story of Exodus and Passover and that of Jesus Christ--nearly perfect inverse, around the theme of killing our kids.&nbsp; That&#39;s us,&nbsp;<strong>we&#39;re the kids</strong>--and we&#39;re not doing very well here.&nbsp; You can see it clearly in the story of Christ hidden in&nbsp;<a href="http://islam.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Isaac&#39;s</a>&nbsp;life; and you can see it in&nbsp;<a href="http://meth.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>&nbsp;and you can see it in&nbsp;<a href="http://thor.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Thor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://amidallah.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Heimdallr</a>&nbsp;<strong>the point here is that you can see it because it&#39;s my life and this story being told thousands of years before it happened over and over</strong>--and that&#39;s why this is &quot;<a href="http://hyamdai.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">The Holy Name</a>&quot; and that&#39;s why this story being revealed frees us from a repetition in time that has created religion and that repetition really is what &quot;my Hell&quot; means--<a href="http://sob.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">disclosure</a>, ending the secrecy inside religion ends that--so long as we are smart enough to&nbsp;<a href="http://threetag.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank"><strong>listen and not go back</strong></a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The point is that there&#39;s no logical reason to hide this story, and every reason in the world to share it--literally it brings us&nbsp;<a href="http://ironclad.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Heaven</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">freedom</a>; and truth be told you&#39;,ll be significantly happier with me than you think at this point, thanks to God&#39;s wonderful insight into &quot;reverse psychology&quot; and &quot;plan for the worst hope for the best&quot; it would be hard for me to be anything but &quot;better than you expect.&quot; &nbsp;What you think of me aside, I&nbsp;<strong>am the person who delivered the message</strong>, with a&nbsp;<a href="http://hammer.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">hammer of emails</a>&nbsp;fighting against the literal most sinister and dangerous enemy of freedom and democracy that humanity has ever seen. &nbsp;<em>I am the person willing to interrupt your dinner by singing &quot;praise for the singing, God&#39;s recreation on the new day&quot; knowing full well it&#39;s not recreational, it&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>the Creation of</strong>&nbsp;a hero</em>, even if I&#39;m not perfect.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this one tiny place, albeit a very important one--the kind of place that actually alters the truth, and popular opinion (and one day might do so...&nbsp;<a href="http://m.lamc.la/ERANDSON.html" target="_blank">more directly</a>) we see a microcosm for&nbsp;<a href="http://censorship.lamc.la/" target="_blank">censorship of this same subject matter</a>&nbsp;that has now effected global media; and a good example of how &quot;ordinary good people&quot; can be used as a weapon against themselves, and against the truth. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>... surreptitiously and surprisingly, using this very same technology.</b></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">These pictures highlight an Egyptian concept, the Ka and Ba--a union of mind and soul that we humorously call "oneness" in western religion. &nbsp;In Egypt there is a much more robust record of what we might call a "history of Gods" that relates directly to Greek and Abrahamic&nbsp;myth. &nbsp;From Atum-Ra (guess), to P'tah (clearly Peter?) to a story of Uniting Two Lands--that is (obvious to me) as the un-parting of a great Holy Sea. &nbsp;I think that's happening now, and I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;<strong>Har-wer</strong>&nbsp;<em>is here.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;<a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/28UjKPg" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/28UjKPg">"wer" is "who?"</a>&nbsp;in German, and matches fairly well with the "<a class="validating" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vq_WDf6NT0" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vq_WDf6NT0">WE R</a>" (POD) that is central to the message you have been reading about.. a lead in from the&nbsp;<a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/28TOl1x" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/28TOl1x">"I AM" of Exodus</a>.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I've told you already that the Days of Creation and the Seals of Revelation are telling us a story about time recursion, about this event... this disruption in the slide towards darkness... happening several times. &nbsp;That in itself is a little bit disconcerting, understanding that a large part of this message is about not&nbsp;<em>going back</em>&nbsp;and yet, here we are. &nbsp;I have never lived another life, but in ancient Egypt and in Judeo-Christian myth I&nbsp;<strong><a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/1UHgjO0" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/1UHgjO0">see so many references to&nbsp;<em>this life</em>&nbsp;that it's clear</a></strong>&nbsp;that there is a huge focus on what I am doing--if you can conceptualize that this place has been built to ensure the survival of civilization itself through a technological singularity that has... up until now... been hidden from nearly everyone; you may understand why&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;is so important. &nbsp;It is the true purpose of all religion, and from my perspective what we do with the information that religion reveals about our history and technology is the reason that life itself continues, that civilization is finally "salvaged"&nbsp;<em>this time... it's also the reason we finally get to P'tah's&nbsp;</em>never-never land.&nbsp; I think it's because we're finally getting&nbsp;<em>the truth.</em></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><em>There is much more going on here than simply a disclosure of information, or a transfer of technology, the world is fundamentally being changed--albeit I believe from a place that has been made blind--or worse&nbsp;<strong><a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/28XKFfw" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/28XKFfw">negatively impacted by this technology in secret--in order to highlight social problems</a></strong>&nbsp;that may have caused the equivalent of a socio-economic ice age...&nbsp;<strong>in the days of No-Ah.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Financial problems have been highlighted by the low on the S&amp;P in 2008, but hidden within that entire story is a message about using prescient knowledge to prematurely put out a&nbsp;forest&nbsp;fire; the problem always gets worse when it's hidden. &nbsp;It seems clear to me that this disruption is designed to stop a slide into the Dark Ages, something that you might not realize relates to JC and the "Fall of Rome." &nbsp;Throughout our history, in addition to religion, are metaphorical references to right this second... and in the highlighted list of "Anti-Christs" throughout history there's a very central common theme--the destruction of a republic and a descent into fascism. &nbsp;The names of these people, from JC (Julius Caesar) to Na<strong><a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/28S9Oq9" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/28S9Oq9">poleon</a></strong>&nbsp;(who is linked through the element of Salt, a huge part of this message) to&nbsp;<strong><a class="validating" href="http://bit.ly/1UhM2Td" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/1UhM2Td">ADolf Hitler</a></strong>... the clear message is that losing the voice of people in government creates a steep descent into darkness. &nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I don't really know how to explain this any more clearly than&nbsp;<em>I have the keys to religion,&nbsp;</em>and I am handing them to you. &nbsp;There's an angel singing through us, throughout time, and in the word "Heart' understand he is singing about our home--it's the Heart of Heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This time,&nbsp;</em><a class="validating" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=375HMLtymbc" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=375HMLtymbc">he's mistaken</a><strong>&nbsp;(</strong>Nickelback<strong>)&nbsp;</strong><em>for trying to&nbsp;<a class="validating" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow" rel="nofollow" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow">break our Heart</a>&nbsp;(Brittany Spears).</em></div>
