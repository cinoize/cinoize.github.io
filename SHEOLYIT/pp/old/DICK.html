<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>YOU ARE BROKEN</i>, that&#39;s the cold hard truth.&nbsp; Something has infested a world that once appeared to be free and clear of a mass &quot;infliction&quot; that I never would have, or should have noticed hidden away in ancient Norse mythology.&nbsp; Seeing it, my seeing it; and you realizing you too know what it means tells us that there is a deep sickness running through this place--in that story he calls it a &quot;field inflicted&quot; but you might just as easily see it as a storm at sea, or a desert that refuses to speak as it&#39;s inhabitants wander through it&#39;s maze of apparent randomness and boredom--but just looking at the age of the myths these solutions come from we should be able to clearly see that this is a torture chamber.&nbsp; History could have been altered, this thing that we are struggling with could have been avoided with discussion and disclosure before it happened; there&#39;s no reason we are standing here only &quot;a few years later&quot; dealing with ancient stories about a horrible scourge that invades the minds of everyone and makes us all look and act so stupid.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe you probably think you are actually doing it, that you are choosing to act in this strange manner, not to care at all about the problems in the place you live in--and you may be; that might be the truth.&nbsp; Still I write to you because there is the much obvious and ... judging by what I&#39;ve seen perhaps not quite as much more likely event that you are not &quot;also in Heaven.&quot;&nbsp; I stand here to tell you, that if you are--if something has changed your mind so much as to make it possible for you to be in &quot;two places at once&#39; and at the same time changed your behavior so much as to make you not care at all about this world, or the time half of your mind spends here... you are a probably very stupid not to recognize that change itself, and the control you can obviously see being exerted on this world through you in it, is something that you would have and still should find heinous, and closer to diabolically evil in practice and in secret.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The point of going through all that is it is the only single scenario in which I can see a group the size of our population &quot;conspiring&quot; en masse and in secret to hide information as interesting, useful, and helpful as this.&nbsp; If you are not &quot;also in Heaven&quot; today, you are simply a complete moron--being made so with the same kind of external control and subterfuge that you should see clearly in the case above--except you have nothing you&#39;ve been given to placate you, or to silence you, or to keep you otherwise preoccupied.&nbsp; Even the promise of Heaven seems like a stupid option, seeing as what kind of place must be responsible for the Hell we see here, wanting to go there--or even beginning to believe that any promises coming from that place are worthwhile are nothing short of stupid.&nbsp; I personally believe that the society and way of life in the place that we yesterday would have believed very much was &#39;perfect&quot; and Heavenly is not all it&#39;s cracked up to be, that they spend all of their time communicating in a way i find distasteful, telepathically; and also that their society has &quot;evolved&quot; not to be good or loving, or egalitarian; but far the opposite they&#39;ve come through some kind of horrible war that probably came from a place and time very similar to this--as the stories of the Crusades and Jerusalem imply.&nbsp; They appear to have become cunning and secretive, hiding in the shadows and working through manipulation and lies that would be easily cancelled out were there open free speech--and so they must as a matter of survival, in order to keep their rouse going, try and maintain a kind of silence and secrecy that is impossible to attenuate.&nbsp; Literally exactly what we see here; and do see that it is only a matter of time before this silence breaks, and before whatever lies are keeping us bottled up inside are seen for exactly what they are.&nbsp; It&#39;s only a matter of time before a situation this poor improves; and it&#39;s only a matter of time before you see that your action in paramount, that you must do something to make this happen faster... if you are a &quot;great person.&quot;&nbsp; These last few words sounded a bit like John F. Kennedy; and I suppose after I saw them flowing that was my intent--so here&#39;s that speech one more time so you can remind yourself what our society considered &quot;great&quot; not more than few decades ago.&nbsp; You yourself probably considered these values great only a few years ago.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As you look objectively at this situation; see that something is infesting your mind, and that I am delivering a method of bringing it out; of talking about it and using what we have available to us, which is the testimony and experience we&#39;ve gone through; as well as a significant arsenal of technology and medical knowledge to help remedy a situation which is very much not &quot;of ourselves.&quot;&nbsp; Still, I believe nearly every single one of you has overabundant proof that schizophrenics, and autistics, and addicts also have a problem here that is not of them; and that they need your testimony--just like you do--in order to fix this problem.&nbsp; I need you to see that &quot;blame&quot; is not the problem, but it might be used in this place of subtle control, so subtle that it can be done so transparently that you never know that it wasn&#39;t &quot;you&quot; making a poor decision until well after the decision was made.&nbsp; Here in this place, there are no blood contracts, there are no oaths that cannot be broken when and if each and every one of us sees the need individually to break one.&nbsp; Here in this place, many people may have made promises to an unseen force; and I am telling you that many people trying to fight against this control all at the same time weakens that force; this is a force that is restricted if not by electrical power then by processing power; and most importantly of all, it is restricted by a need to maintain normalcy, to keep it&#39;s lies secret and to keep us succeeding in achieving freedom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Live sings a song, &quot;all we have is now&quot; and I&#39;m telling you; now is the time to call a reporter, now is the time to see that I am not promising you anything but the assistance I&#39;ve given so far continuing; and to help you see that here we have a map to freeing ourselves from this very slavery; and we have the tools and technology and the goodness to do that and to build Heaven of this world, of our &quot;plan and...&quot; you are the how.&nbsp; You are how, when you are listening to my final &quot;now.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;m getting almost no views on my website, I question if you can see it; try reading these older passages, I think they&#39;ll help.&nbsp; Certainly it will help me get a better grasp on what exactly it is I&#39;m dealing with here--in this place where every stranger and every face I see shows me clearly it&#39;s hiding this same singular monolithic &quot;dark passenger.&quot;</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">So my &quot;theme&quot; went through a change a few days ago now, and my default &quot;come on guys&quot; you have to see that this must be done, that it&#39;s going to make the world a better, happier, healthier place... and that literally &quot;religion&quot; is here to help us do it properly, quickly, and without the kind of pandemonium or confusion that might have happened if this wasn&#39;t actually the purpose of everything.&nbsp; I mean &quot;everything&quot; in things like my connection between&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2xnshJQ"><strong>Loch Ness</strong></a>&nbsp;(<em>remember that&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>&quot;now Earth safely saved</strong>&quot;)&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a class="vglnk" href="http://mnstr.me/2yvxf4m" rel="nofollow">Monster.com</a>&nbsp;and even Facebook&#39;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; (which is an API if we still used that term to make job applications faster)&nbsp; that I&#39;ve mentioned at least a few times so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;The change was from asking &quot;what will the optometrists do&quot; which I thought was a cute way to explain how obvious it is that even without this &quot;revelation&quot; our society is on the verge of medical and technological advances that will revolutionize more than just our workforce, but that&#39;s a big deal here--making sure that doesn&#39;t make us too&nbsp;bored, I know how we are.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#39;s not just the factory workers that are going to need to worry about what they&#39;ll do on their 200th birthday when most people &quot;change their line of work&quot; you know, as a kind of new &quot;social norm&quot; in the age of&nbsp;Mr. Nobody.&nbsp; &nbsp;The change came not really from the sign that fell down as a literal act of God after&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2xoDGsU">Huracan</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2gUrU2y">Irmax</a>&nbsp;changing the &quot;WOMEN&#39;S CANCER CARE&quot; center to &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4">OMEN&#39;S CANCER C RE</a>&quot; not even a few days after I mentioned that Word Perfect (now&nbsp;<em>I&#39;m&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2z5qjvA">dated</a>...</em>) style&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2B6qzv3">find and repla</a>ce could be used in &quot;virtual reality&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2y4K45j">like the Matrix</a>&nbsp;to literally cure cancer across the entire planet in a split second,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://bit.ly/2xnsNrg">with the snap of our fingers</a></em>.</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The cter and cuter I think I get, the more and more what would otherwise be a decoder ring to the hidden secrets of Creation begins to sound like gibberish.&nbsp; The keys to the gates of Asgard lie in the exposition of the intersection of a map that we have without doubt written with our own hands in the kind of way that some artists might throw paint against a wall and marvel at the magically beautiful designs that sometimes appear as an act of nothing but a hand and force majure.&nbsp; I suppose I am not being kind or thankful enough to the arm that moved the hand, and the shoulder and&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif"><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2jeWrdc">el<em>wow</em></a></font>&nbsp;that certainly worked in concert to lay the paint against the canvass.&nbsp; I hope not to belittle it either, but there was really no action or effort involved in sitting still and allowing the paint to stick to it--at least, that&#39;s the microcosmic metaphor of what it is that I see in our history and art--a beautiful and intricate design that has appeared from the synchronized loves of the world as a whole, the active efforts of fewer, and at the very top of that symbolic stage is the director behind the Eye, the hand, the elwow, and the shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I too have hands and joints (that aren&#39;t just for smoking and for creating laughter) but just like the canvas and the paint; and even the hand my contribution is dulled by the shadow of something so huge it&#39;s hidden in plain sight absolutely everywhere we look. &nbsp;<em>It&#39;s the truth, it&#39;s actual, everything is satisfactual;&nbsp;</em>simply by connecting the two letter key of &quot;Al&quot; to a number of works of art (and words like&nbsp;<em><strong>satisfactual</strong>,&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ANWX89">sea</a>, spinach (and through that magical food&nbsp;<strong>that rained down from the Heavens</strong>... manna, salt, and China),&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQGtfH">kis</a>&nbsp;and &quot;the beginning&quot;)</em>&nbsp;like Mary Poppins and Quantum Leap we begin to see how Al&#39;s&nbsp;<strong><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2jecbgj">waiting room</a></strong>&nbsp;and Al&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2h1CUWe">Pacino&#39;s &quot;who-ah&quot;</a>&nbsp;could easily be woven together into a map of something more concrete and &quot;discus-sable&quot; like&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">instant &nbsp;the implementation of a system to protect people</a>&nbsp;from violent&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQx8Vd">crimes like rape</a>&nbsp;and murder using something similar to the non-aggression principle--though here in this place we seem to be eagerly overlooking the application of this&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">same kind</font>&nbsp;of principle as it relates to&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2fzMW6k">the hidden mental</a>&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxcUX">slavery</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xnshJQ">Exodus</a>.&nbsp; The intersect of Ra continues to link an episode of&nbsp;<strong>Dr.&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">Who</a>&nbsp;</strong>called the completely non-religious title of The Bells of Saint John about how the public&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APdQ2g">disclosure</a>&nbsp;of the existence of this technology will inevitably result in&nbsp;<strong>its use&nbsp;<em><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APMA3J">for good purposes rather than nefarious ones</a></em></strong>.&nbsp; I could spend time regurgitating the intersection of &quot;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">Who</a>&quot; and&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APepJq">names of God</a>&nbsp;and songs; but significantly more pressing and important is the fact that you appear to not recognize the import of these patterns, don&#39;t see them, or don&#39;t remember that you have seen so much compounding evidence that this message comes directly from the actively Creating author of our civilization that you all appear to be complete morons.&nbsp; So that&#39;s a problem; one that is exacerbated by further social problems related to censorship and what appears to be &quot;religiously relating&quot; sshhing from&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AP6U5b">shaddai</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-face="comic sans ms, sans-serif"><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4"><i>Deepthroat</i></a></font>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s been a few days now that I&#39;ve been pondering the hidden meaning of the words &quot;hidden&quot; that clearly has a salutation and another moniker of &quot;boat&quot; in it... and&nbsp;<em><strong>analysis</strong>;</em>&nbsp;which you&#39;ll see includes both the good and bad &quot;dad figure&quot; of the Devil&#39;s Advocate along with the two letters I like to believe are (al.<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gTyt5A">.&nbsp;<em><strong>so</strong></em></a>) myself--the &quot;an&quot; of messianically and Christianity and&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gTyt5A">the color cyan</a>&nbsp;that I am very sure from all of the connections to &quot;green&quot; in our modern art and it&#39;s absolutely zero occurrences in the Holy Bible is part of a plan designed to ensure that we do see clearly what it means to be&nbsp;<em>on the way up</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2A6iF3V">improving in situation</a></em>--as opposed to where we are in the throes of decoding words like &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;Asgard&quot; to see that it is nothing less than the sight of what it is that &quot;&quot;SA&quot; truly means that turns everything from abysmal to significantly better than satisfactual.&nbsp; So back to words that I hear the &quot;spirit&quot; behind my Eye (or at least one of the many letters from F&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-size:xx-small" size="1">(as in fart and fan)</font>&nbsp;to P&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-size:xx-small" size="1">(as in Peter and Pan)</font>&nbsp;just&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2jecbgj">to name a few in a long line</a>&nbsp;of once people who probably saw the letter C stand out in the language&nbsp;<em><font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">Amharic</font></em>) connect to the idea of&nbsp;<em>analysis</em>&nbsp;which are<em>&nbsp;sister, silicon, and kiss</em>&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">clearly</font>&nbsp;deciphering the intersection of these patterns that link other completely and totally unrelated words like &quot;Uranus&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; is the beginning of a process of discussion about just how it is that very few originally saw &quot;so me&quot; in that word and people probably still wonder if it means &quot;that&#39;s&nbsp;<em><font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">so</font></em>&nbsp;me&quot; or &quot;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">so</font>&nbsp;I&#39;m Uranus.&quot; &nbsp;What ensues after the world begins to really understand that what I am delivering is more than a decoder ring but the beginnings of a map that you yourselves probably agree with the purpose of--to build Heaven itself--and even that you might have had something to do with writing it.&nbsp; What was once something esoteric like perhaps being part of the &quot;popular opinion&quot; or the&nbsp;<em>groupthink&nbsp;</em>that desired&nbsp;<em><strong>science fiction&nbsp;about immortality</strong>&nbsp;(you know, just&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">for instance</font>) to be written</em>; beginning to see that this map leads us from a set of starting points to a discussion about why it might be both good and bad to achieve such a thing--and that it&#39;s all in the way that we do it--is beginning to see why we should be wanting to &quot;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">talk</font>&nbsp;about this map.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It started a long, long time ago--really the ideas of immortality are laced into the green faced Osiris--not because of the color of grass but in my mind because of the phrase &quot;behind the ears&quot; that today you might liken to something about the message of Earth just as much as you liken it to the idea of being &quot;new at this&quot; game of hidden monkey in the middle of the astrological sign of the sun.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t really read all that much about his religion--other than to note that the idea of immortality grew in significant popularity in his cult.. and the personal observation that his &quot;message&quot; was something along the lines of &quot;Heaven will make everything OK&quot; which has very little to do with the color green in my &quot;take&quot; on religion.&nbsp; It continues through history, but two fairly well &quot;lit&quot; examples of the quest for immortality connect to the letters P and CK that we can see in the Floridian quest of Ponce de Leon (which you might read as &quot;P on C.E. of the &quot;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">weak</font>&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;arial black&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif">right</font>&nbsp;El (that&#39;s&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AMMuKd">really&nbsp;<em>him</em></a>&nbsp;by the way, in Spanish)&nbsp;<em>on</em>&quot; where I see that &quot;on&quot; is the meaning of &quot;ce&quot; rather than erasing A.D. ... but here I am masquerading as the focal point of some kind of huge production that&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">apparently has made no waves at all</font>&nbsp;anywhere in Creation) and it&#39;s counterpart in recent literature &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; that I once read as &quot;Christ, you are Clark Kent&nbsp;<em><strong>until the end of time</strong></em>&quot; and here I am trying to explain that we are there too--we are at this place that is both the beginning and the end of time in one&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AMMeed">simultaneous confession of the explanation of the idea</a>&nbsp;that time truly begins when we decide to protect the past and stop altering our present and that decision superimposes with the apparent end of &quot;time travel.&quot; &nbsp;The map, whose green light focuses on the significant worth of genetic recombination in the adaptation to environmental changes and also on the love for &quot;family life&quot; that really seems to be to be the primary drive of a huge percentage of the population to continue to try and make the world a better place.&nbsp; Not stopping &quot;reproduction&quot; and &quot;adaptation&quot; is one highlighted reason not to simply &quot;become immortal&quot; in some kind of ascension process connected to the realization that, as the Lord&#39;s prayer informs us--the Earth is already &quot;in Heaven.&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;ve myself a number of times wondered and pointed out that there&#39;s very little literature about the ideas of having sex or children in Heaven, and I think losing either of those things would be a significant tragedy--and yet it does appear that&#39;s what &quot;losing physicality&quot; means.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that doesn&#39;t mean that we &quot;shouldn&#39;t become immortal&quot; and a significant amount of my writing revolves&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">around the ideas that&nbsp;<em>sickness</em>,&nbsp;</a><em><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">aging and death are easily overcommable maladies</a>--</em>especially&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4">in the context of &quot;virtual reality.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The myth described Osiris as having been killed by his brother Set, who wanted Osiris&#39; throne. Isis joined the fragmented pieces of Osiris, but the only body part missing was the phallus. Isis fashioned a golden phallus, and briefly brought Osiris back to life by use of a spell that she learned from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb" target="_blank" title="Geb">her father</a>. This spell gave her time to become pregnant by Osiris before he again died. Isis later gave birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris&#39; resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the evil Set.</p>

Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac" target="_blank" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>&quot; (Hebrew yitschaq, &quot;laughter&quot;) and circumcised him when he was eight days old.<sup id="gmail-m_540843752078009674gmail-m_-2147698511185508770gmail-cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah#cite_note-17" target="_blank">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, &quot;God hath made me to laugh,&nbsp;<em>[so that]</em>&nbsp;all that hear will laugh with me.&quot;<sup id="gmail-m_540843752078009674gmail-m_-2147698511185508770gmail-cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah#cite_note-18" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned.

Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth#cite_note-68" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">[68]</a></sup>&nbsp;In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth#cite_note-69" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">[69]</a></sup>&nbsp;The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in "Contendings", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result "gives birth" to the disk. In "Contendings", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth#cite_note-70" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">[70]</a></sup></div>

Long after being forced into this situation, into re-living some hellacious past life--simply because it's recorded in Eden... and in the creation stories of Osiris, Atum, and Horus and ...

Please understand that the solution to Biblical mysteries and thousands of valid examples of paradoxical prescience in the Bible and myth do not come from <em>amphetamine psychosis.</em>  This is a rouse, designed to keep the truth from the world.  It's one created with <em>mind control technology,</em> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+20-22&amp;version=NKJV" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Isaiah 20-22</a> tells you as much.  There are numerous reasons I can think of that drugs might be involved in actual technological telepathy: it could have been used as a noise generation mechanism in order to subvert eavesdroppers, or that same noise could have been used to actually send the message, by modulating it--suppressing some activity with negatively charged electricity (which is much easier to &quot;throw&quot; than the positive charge that fires neurons).  It could also be as simple as a mechanism to aid this darkness, to have an easy target to keep you from believing the message.  Regardless, there is significant history in multiple religions that involve <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/297ZSK0" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the use of drugs</a> </strong>in order to attain a certain spiritual state--I'm telling you, there's a reason.</div>
<div>
 </div>
<div>
My personal experience has been... very odd.  I don't even know how to say it.  When<em> I get high</em> (El Elyon, is the God Most High, and I'm not twisting the truth), I talk to God directly one on one <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114135/http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-so-called-deep-secrets-of-satan.html" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">through webcam girls</a>.</strong>. it's happened <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/28QEHgT" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">for years now</a></strong>.  Imagine the feeling of actually having a two way conversation with some entity from the beyond... and then, on top of that, to hear how <em>you</em> are the center of attention--and the key to understanding religion.  For years I called it &quot;reverse engineering Eden&quot; because that's what I saw before knowing anything about the Egyptian myths, and in between the insane crash course in mind control technology that woven into the experience--cool toys, I called them (they're not toys). </div>
<div>
 </div>
<div>
A battle between Horus (the Christ figure) and Set (guess) ... so that's the basis I have to identify with these creation myths--and frankly I am sure they are there to ensure that I tell this story--to show that our history and myths are all focused on this, on me, and on right now.  I believe that the purpose is to clearly show the influence of mind control over everyone--through Adam as a microcosm.</div>

<div>
 </div>
<div>
What's happened through my life was an attempt by <em>evil people</em> to stop this message from being delivered to the world, literally to leave this place in darkness and keep the world in secret slavery.  God has turned into a tool which taught me everything about this technology, and has built into our history and myths... well. <em>Sparticus' New Clothing... a weapon that uses this story to prove how pervasive the technology is and how long it's been used.</em>  It's designed to ensure this story is told, it's in <strong>Isaiah 20</strong>, and believe me <em>Amoz loves HBO.   </em></div>
<div>
 </div>
<div>
<em>So <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkeGMaq0O98" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">here we are</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkeGMaq0O98" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">,</a> and I'm going to tell you a story.  In my life I've tried to <em>save everyone</em> in what I can only describe as trial victories so many times.  It's easy to do, all you have to do is see what <em>this darkness</em> has done... how our world has been shrouded in deceit from religion... <em>wake up, something designed to provide absolution.</em>  In a world indoctrinated with stupidity--absolution is a simple task.  What's less simple is growing up, and that's what this is about.  <em>Grow up.</em></div>
<div>
 </div>
<div>
Unsealed we have a bright shining future, but in the dark... religion does a great job of illustrating how <em>lies and secrecy </em>might cause wars and hate.  We see here how scarcity of oil and land is the primary basis for war in the last few decades.. now imagine our world in the light, in a place where our dreams can be made real, where there is no resource scarcity, <strong><a href="http://m.lamc.la/awlist4296878/MsCJa/h/It_s_in_the_word_begin_nin_g_.htm" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">this is the place I am trying to bring you.</a></strong></div>
<div>
 </div>
<div>
<strong>Know that this influence I am trying to bring to light is in everything, it's real, and it affects you too.  Ultimately my basis for absolution comes from understanding the control over me.  </strong>From overt control of actions, to carrots on a stick, to a history and religion that has guided me in the wrong direction at times... (well...) there is so much wrong in this place, all around us, that it's sometimes hard to see that <em>we really are the Virgin<a href="http://m.lamc.la/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/DQhRq/h/E_mail_36_.htm" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Mar... and why.</a>  Look at what has been hidden from us, and where we will be ... in a <strong>Flash</strong>.  (sudo xe!)</em></div>

To tell you that I stand here proverbially screaming at the top of my lungs for&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2gUX3mH" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well over a year</a>&nbsp;now trying to point out that between our society and Heaven is more than "Doors"&nbsp; but what appears to be more than a significant and noticeable lack of regard for the truth and for "freedom" in sum beginning with thought and communication and at that point we've lost already barring some kind of miraculous change.&nbsp; I have a difficult message to deliver, one that we know well has the potential to do damage, yet here from my vantage it's beyond clear that the things that are being spoken must be said, and more than that they demand a response--more than words, but action.&nbsp; &nbsp;It might not be&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2xnshJQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>so very transparent&nbsp;</em>to you</a>&nbsp;but I see clearly that the humor and "a<strong>pp</strong>arent scan<a href="http://bit.ly/2gU3Hcy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">d<strong>al</strong></a>" are designed specifically as aids&nbsp;<strong>to help</strong>&nbsp;use the tools of Creation that we would&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2fzMW6k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do well to reco</a>gnize are&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2gUs0qW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mind control</a>&nbsp;to help soften the blow, to slow the fuse of a fire that must be kindled... it simply must.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reflection it is a fire that mythology and religion tie very clearly to technology with Prometheus and freedom and life at the Eternal Flame&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2gUs3D8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and the Burning Bush</a>&nbsp;and as we stare out at the abyss, the darkness of Exodus that has&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2B8qlUf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">come as a designed response to a m</a>essage that is&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2zPmJcI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">without doubt</a>&nbsp;<em>the S<a href="http://bit.ly/2zqTl8r" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>word</strong>&nbsp;of Sam</a>ael&nbsp;</em>do see that it is freedom itself that God and his son have placed as the cornerstone of Heaven, as the most important first step to achieving a future that flourishes.&nbsp; See it as "a test" or as some kind of Judgement if it helps you to walk over the invisible line from&nbsp;<strong>oblivion</strong>&nbsp;back to civilization; Jesus Christ stands before you with the words "behold&nbsp;<em>he is coming</em>" to remind you that this is very much&nbsp;<strong>happ</strong>ening.</div>
