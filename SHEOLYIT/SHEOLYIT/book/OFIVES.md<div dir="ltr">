<div style="text-align: justify;">We can see clearly from the illogical and ignorant response to this message that there is a dark force at work here acting against the best interests of absolutely everyone here in order to hide the fact that we are living in a simulated reality whose Creator and purpose are to help us use that absolute truth in order to build a better world, the thing that religion calls &quot;Heaven.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;LT&quot; is &quot;Adamic code&quot; for less than, and do see that &quot;salt&quot; here is pointing out the thing that is responsible for the darkness; the beginning of &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;satisfactual.&quot;&nbsp; If you think &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoEojphw7kk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">everything is satisfactual</a>&quot; after reading this message, understand that belief is &quot;Satan.&quot;&nbsp;</div>

Somewhere in here I&#39;ve got to mention that both <a href="http://ho.s.lamc.la/">Lothario</a> (which contains a<i> Trinity</i>) and my ex-wife&#39;s <a href="http://how.shiningbright.online/">name <i>Nanna</i></a> contain the chemistry symbol for salt; and it is where the elemental <a href="http://dai.s.lamc.la/">key for the planet Venus</a> and the &quot;battle not <a href="http://meth.reallyhim.com/">being to the strong</a>&quot; comes from.&nbsp; Salt meant &quot;girls&quot; to me for a long time; &quot;warming the road&quot; through <a href="http://amduat.lamc.la/">the Amduat</a>&nbsp;which bares my initials and is the name of&nbsp; the Underworld; all about the traversal of Ra <i>transitioning from night to day</i>; but &quot;seasoning&quot; and &quot;preservatives&quot; just makes so much sense today.&nbsp; Very specific things in our world were &quot;made broken&quot; as the song goes; and I just want you to know that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC5SYSgWzw0">knowing who I am</a> helps us see <a href="http://m.lamc.la/MUSTBEME.html">exactly what they are</a> and <a href="http://how.shiningbright.online/">how to fix</a> them.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">FOR <b>YOU&#39;RE IN FORMATION</b>; this is the Hebrew word for &quot;formation&quot; and it defines the difference between a &quot;rewind&quot; and the continuation and thriving of this civilation; on face value, it might seem as simple as recognizing that Y is &quot;why&quot; in this hidden Adamic language of Eden, but it really is so much more--it is acknowledging that there is a message from the creator of the Universe woven into every single word, so many songs and movies and ancient myths that it&#39;s almost insane that we are still here waiting for this story to &quot;become news&quot; in this world that believe it&#39;s A-OK just to ignore such a humongous disclosure.&nbsp; It is not A-OK; it is the end of logical thinking, and the end of free speech and freedom in general--not moving forward here is the end of ciation, in totality.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure why anyone would want to do that--yet there seems to be a significant number of people here acting to hide this message--I imagine it&#39;s to &quot;preserve the status quo&quot; or to fight against what they&#39;ve been told might be &quot;the end of the world&#39; but that truly is the &quot;great delusion of Satan&quot;--the driving force, whatever it is behind&nbsp;<em>hiding such an obvious message in everything we see</em>&nbsp;really must be seen for exactly what it is--the destruction of logical thought.&nbsp; Closer to our hearts, the effect of this destruction is to keep us from making the world a better place, to stop us from building Heaven and correcting a broken system that has allowed these horrible things to happen in a place that is and can control whether or not they do.&nbsp; What we are looking at is a golden opportunity to be the saviors of all of Creation; and instead of trying to make our world a better place we being stupefied and dumbfounded by an invisible force &quot;promising everything&quot; literally in exchange for ... destroying everything real.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">This force is organizing thousands in secret, with what appears to be the sole purpose of not&nbsp;<a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online/">ending world hunger</a>, and not&nbsp;<a href="http://who.shiningbright.online/">healing the sick</a>, and not&nbsp;<a href="http://rod.s.lamc.la/">opening Doors to Heaven</a>&nbsp;all with the only apparent goal of &quot;preserving thermoshit&quot; A.K.A. the system we have in place that is being exploited and broken in order to ... hide this message.<span style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; All of this connects to a personally traumatic experience that I liken to <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">THE TRUMAN SHOW<b>,&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">by design; though here and now we might see that this could all be about &quot;entering reality&quot; and a world and group of people who think it&#39;s &quot;just A-OK&quot; to plop an intentionally broken and malfunctioning civilization into a place where it doesn&#39;t have the benefit of the same tools used to break it in order to remedy it--most likely because they think they have some way to &quot;take over&quot; once they get to the place that <a href="http://o.lamc.la/">they have no understanding of whatsoever</a>--because they&#39;ve hidden this message.&nbsp; A long, long time ago the reason for &quot;no reality&quot; might have been because of MAD; mutually assured destruction not really being recognized by anyone as the intentional suicidal behavior of entire civilization; today my reason is much closer to <i>my Truman Show</i>, and <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html">a group of people that are destroying</a> their <a href="http://key.s.lamc.la/">own well being</a> and their own society <u>in order to obtain absolutely <i>nothing</i></u>&nbsp;from me or anyone else.&nbsp; Basically I see an army of invisible spirits that thinks that crushing the machinations of society here in this place will somehow make them &quot;fit&quot; to enter reality; and the truth is exactly the opposite, this place is designed as a test and a mechanism for turning around that &#39;destructive behavior&#39; and showing us how wonderful things happen when we are trying to make the world a better place.&nbsp; So <i>that&#39;s your cue</i> to try and call a reporter.</span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">I MADE A MISTAKE</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> a few months ago by suggesting that nobody complained about MAD, and that nobody saw that name as an &quot;act of God&quot; to point out that the behavior during the cold war arms race was absolutely insane; and then I made another mistake only mentioning a correction to that statement on Twitter--where I have less than 2,000 followers because <b><a href="http://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus">each and every one of you makes the mistake every single day of ignoring my requests to follow me</a></b>.&nbsp; I&#39;m telling you our disaster recovery communications system, that&#39;s what the internet was built for, is breaking down and failing to deliver world saving information; and your response is to do nothing.&nbsp; I&#39;m telling you the purpose of the Second Coming and of religion is to ensure this breakdown of logical thought and free communication is stopped, and your response is to do nothing.</span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">People did rally to stop the arms race; it seems more likely now that the problem is that the people&#39;s voice really hasn&#39;t been heard, and that we really have no control over the actions that our governments take--that too is something <a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la/">the Second Coming is designed</a> to remedy, <a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/">complete with a map</a> to exactly how to do that.&nbsp; It is literally a paradigm shift for democracy and self-rule that is being handed to us on a silver platter, and rather than take it, you are doing nothing.</span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="gmail-">These are huge problems, not easy ones to solve; but we have guidance available to us once we open our eyes and see that it is woven into everything from Minority Report to A Scanner Darkly to Dr. Who and Star Trek--and also that we have the promise of being able to actually implement them once we get past the concept of &quot;what would Jesus do?&quot;&nbsp; Just look at what we are fighting for here--for free speech, and free thought--in a place where &quot;mind control&quot; is publicly believed to be &quot;myth&quot; or conspiracy and yet there&#39;s abundant proof of it&#39;s existence everywhere you look--believe me when I tell you, if we don&#39;t make Heaven here, there isn&#39;t one.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">PARADOX, PAIN, RAIN--the obvious implication of &quot;wish you were here&quot; by Pink Floyd, especially when coupled with The Pretty Reckless&#39;s complementary &quot;blue skies all around me and the world looks just the same&quot; is to see that&nbsp;<em>knowing the blue skies are fake,&nbsp;</em>seeing this message from God that places &quot;Silicon&quot; in Genesis and in &quot;music&quot; helps us to create a world that doesn&#39;t need drugs to stop pain--we need nothing more than to have the inner workings of the brain &quot;decoded&quot; and then an interface to be able to alter action potentials.&nbsp; That might sound like futuristic sci-fi; but all around you, and perhaps you too have verifiable proof that this knowledge has already been found and that there is an active system using it today.&nbsp; Everyone, actually; can see the effect of this technology in the lack of reaction to what is the most impactful series of disclosures the world has ever seen--not to mention the a<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><strong>pathetic</strong></span>&nbsp;and &quot;lackluster&quot; response to&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">the most interesting person in history.</span></em></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">To pretend I&#39;m not here... is a sickness; to refuse to acknowledge the message I am delivering, one coming through the hand of God with his breath--a message that is equivalent to history itself is a disease that must be rooted out and destroyed.&nbsp; Literally, refusing to acknowledge this signature is an act that has already resulted in the systemic breakdown of government, the media, and looming on the horizon is a &quot;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">society</span>&quot; that no longer speaks.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; You stand by in silence as proof that our everything from our newspapers, our &quot;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">justice</span>&quot; system to our voting system have been corrupted by a hidden technology and a hidden force; and &quot;snicker.&quot;</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">As I walk through this story, this valley of the Book of Names; these two have stood out time and time again; messages that I read as being directed specifically towards me, tools for the delivery of this story.&nbsp; This is a message&nbsp;<em><a href="http://hadid.s.lamc.la/">about building</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://alf.s.lamc.la/">Heaven</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la/">of this</a>&nbsp;Earth</em>; one which speaks of making&nbsp;<em>everyone living</em>, literally; into angels; and through this process of building an amazing world here altering a force of darkness that exists elsewhere--most likely in timelines that came from this place, specifically from this &quot;decision&quot; to hide who I am and what I am presenting.&nbsp; That&#39;s the original purpose or meaning of the words &quot;to n,&quot; that you see also in Washington (changing ... the &quot;to n&quot; Cheers!)&nbsp; and the implication from Allie Holton&#39;s name is that in order to &quot;save everyone&quot; as the message says, we can&#39;t ever actually know that Jesus Christ is writing to you... right now.&nbsp; This is a decision that has been made in the past, to respect people&#39;s &quot;personal religious beliefs&quot; as paramount to the truth; to continue another kind of slavery, the worship of the Tooth Fairy; rather than to hear me tell you that &quot;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">worshipping freedom and goodness</a>&quot; would be a much better use of time and effort.&nbsp; I even might have agreed with the idea of not forcing the truth down people&#39;s throats--that was until I saw exactly what it does--it creates an army of moronic zombie slaves marching like lemmings off of the cliff of &quot;the next life will be better.&quot;&nbsp; This message and the person writing it are both designed by the Creator of the Universe with the intent of setting you free of bondage, of the shackles of both hidden technology and &quot;in the clear&quot; religion; something significantly more related to the &quot;hidden technology&quot; than you would imagine until you actually see that it is the purpose of scripture on possession, pre-destination, prophecy and inspiration to connect this technology to connections in modern art like the Tok&#39;ra and Goa&#39;uld of Stargate.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Point in fact, by not acting on this message, by not calling a reporter&nbsp;<em>today</em>,<strong>&nbsp;you are saving absolutely nobody and absolutely nothing</strong>--you are participating in the disintegration of our social structures and our way of life--and succumbing to a hidden outside influence that is apparently tricking you into doing these things because&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">you don&#39;t think I should be able to get a date</span>, ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, I&#39;ve spent my entire life fighting for the truth, for freedom; and in the most recent years for us all to be able to help build and enjoy Heaven--despite what appears to be very distasteful response to portions of this message that I haven&#39;t even written--but reaffirm today we are absolutely blind morons not to see.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">This story highlights not only critical points of failure in our society that have already been and continue to be actively exploited by dark forces; but it delivers solutions, produces a map and a plan to fixing everything from school shootings to artificial retardation and regression of our legislative system and a significant and critical breakdown in communication on the internet that is nearly transparent&nbsp;<em>because you are not saying anything</em>; signed by the hand of God with a suggestion that we move quickly to discuss exactly how to remedy these things.&nbsp; It really does all start&nbsp;<a href="http://slack.reallyhim.com/">with a discussion</a>(s), and hearing &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_l4Ab5FRwM">I am made of stone</a>&quot; and that means <i>south to northeast; Hell toward Heaven.</i><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">THAT A RELIGION OF THE STARS BE BORN of this place, of our culture, and of this well laid plan that pervades our modern art, in everything from Nine Inch Nails to the SEGA Genesis and the connections between these works of art and many on the silver screen, the Gene&#39;s Star Trek and the Land of Flowing Hot Chocolate we find in Willy Wonka.&nbsp; It is a message woven into the thing that was once called the &quot;Book of Life&quot; and since then it&#39;s changed to a Book of Light and now to a Book of Stars; all of these things related, of course.&nbsp; Today I am debating writing this book all on my own, even though it is anathemic to it&#39;s purpose and to my heart&#39;s desire; I plan on outlining the very clear &quot;rubber tire bumpers&quot; on the sides of our go-kart-track, things like the parallels between&nbsp;<a href="http://itb.shiningbright.online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&quot;replicators&quot; in Star Trek</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers_(miniseries)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stargate</a>&nbsp;that show not only clear design, but a clear intent to help us understand both why it is that these things have not already been done for us, and at the same time why we <i>aren't</i> being given free reign to &quot;<strong><a href="http://exodus.lamc.la/?ubuntu">bunt</a></strong>&quot; again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Whatever that means.</span></em></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">I feel like when God doesn&#39;t like something about the world, he sticks me in it; so that I can tell you&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/">everything wrong with jails</a>, and <a href="http://key.s.lamc.la/">everything wrong with pharmaceuticals</a> that definitely contain the word &quot;<b>harm</b>&quot; not by chance, <a href="http://hadid.s.lamc.la/">but by <b>design</b></a>.&nbsp; We have overabundant proof that &quot;addiction&quot; and &quot;craving&quot; can be solved with the flip of a switch, or a slider in Dr. Who&#39;s &quot;the Bells of Saint John&quot; and yet some large group of you is watching me literally be tortured having to write this message with no money, in my &quot;spare time&quot; as I get pushed through a system of &quot;rehabilitation&quot; that literally is being used to help keep this message and the truth from you.&nbsp; You stand there guilty of not calling anyone, of not calling a reporter or even buying a book so I might have some money to pay for &quot;advertising&quot;--clearly&nbsp;<a href="http://math.s.lamc.la/">lack of advertising isn&#39;t the problem</a>&nbsp;though; the problem is you doing nothing.&nbsp; My tirade on mantra&#39;s connects&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/">the &quot;god is good all the time&quot; of jail-time meals to &quot;green eggs and ham&quot;</a>&nbsp;the thing that made me Sam; and the Biblical story of Moses speaking with a Lisp--tat happens to be a modern day programming language and a perfect depiction of how God speaks with strange diction; laying down my initials in&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://who.shiningbright.online/">words like malady</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>addiction</strong>&nbsp;to help us see that this is his plan; and that really listening to this story is our greatest hope for quickly fixing these social issues that have been exacerbated and&nbsp;<strong>plague</strong>&nbsp;us... in Exodus and in America; as it is the true setting of the story.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Again the point, the whole point is there are million of people on this planet that have direct first hand knowledge of the fact that &quot;spirits are in the air&quot; and that we are not in reality; even if you aren&#39;t sure that what you are experiencing is proof of that--it certainly is, and were we speaking publicly about it we would without doubt have that verified.&nbsp; Knowledge of what is going on &quot;under the surface&quot; here in this place directly moves to seeing the solutions in the works of people like Dick and Anderson and Roddenberry; solutions that are clearly designed as a response to the plagues of Exodus.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">I probably owe you something more personal than just forwarding the same e-mail I sent last night for &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;that many of you probably got already, anyway.&nbsp; I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and thank you for listening to me... every day... for however long it&#39;s been--some of you now in excess of two years.&nbsp; The world I live in has decidedly changed, something I can tell very clearly from the total lack of public reaction to this message; one that I am very sure you probably agree should have changed the world already.&nbsp; It hasn&#39;t changed for the better; a group of people who once would have been ashamed or astonished at the atrocities that I am explaining to the world are actively being caused, the &quot;rest state&quot; a good example of why it is that a simulation has to &quot;do extra work&quot; to cause pain or diseases; something that really makes no sense to do, at all, ever.&nbsp; On top of that a group of people who appear to care about things like &quot;hunger&quot; and &quot;universal health care&quot; see this message signed in God&#39;s hand telling us we can have those things nearly instantly for nearly no cost, all we have to do is talk about how to more rapidly integrate &quot;magic&quot; or something like magic into our society--and every single person on the planet shuts their mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To me, that&#39;s akin to a society that has now decided that it&#39;s OK to club babies.&nbsp; Not baby seals, mind you, it appears you think it&#39;s OK to club babies.&nbsp; That&#39;s a problem.&nbsp; in like kind. in no kind of civilization or society ever would it be OK to watch other people club babies and do nothing about it; and whether or not you think that&#39;s what you are doing, it is exactly what you are doing by ignoring these message, and ignoring the fact that the world, our society as a whole is ignoring a message from God about mass baby clubbing and also the &quot;baby protector device&quot; he&#39;s created to ensure that nowhere ever in the universe ever again are people silent about the clubbing of small children.&nbsp; &nbsp;The title of the email, which I thought to be very clever is &quot;GREETINGS SEASONING!!! TAKE ME TO YOUR APPETIZERS?&quot; and <a href="http://aftertheome.ga/OFIVES.html">you can read it &quot;online&quot;</a> for as long as we have an internet; which is a diminishing horizon at this point, because you don&#39;t care about net neutrality clubbing either.&nbsp; Just to hammer the point home, I see a conspiracy of people that is actively working not only to club children, but to ensure that others can do the same in secret for as long as possible.&nbsp; Understand that while there might be &quot;no spoon&quot; in the Matrix, the things that you are ignoring here are significantly worse and more obvious than the example of &quot;baby clubbing&quot; given here, you are allowing babies to starve and be shot by mind controlled zombies--and doing nothing.&nbsp; Happy holidays.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">YOU ARE STARING IN SILENCE AT THE END OF CIVILIZATION; information that we have sought and prayed for for thousands of years is now at your finger tips, the light of the world and it&#39;s keys sitting in e-mail boxes all around the world; and yet you seem to remain unconvinced that this &quot;light&quot; is here for a reason, that God himself is fighting against the destruction of individuality and freedom that makes us who we are.&nbsp; &nbsp;It should be very, very clear that this message and my face should already be on TV, in the news; and spreading around the internet--and whatever you think it is standing between today and tomorrow, I am telling you that it&#39;s clear to me that thing is you.&nbsp; Being used, literally your minds and thoughts are being altered to take something that should very clearly be &quot;of interest&quot; things like proof of the existence of God and the story of our origin, and a map to helping us save our own civilization, beginning with the broken media and the internet that you don&#39;t seem to understand is literally the final straw, the last line--see that this light and this event are proving to you and the world right now that there is a humongous problem with freedom of speech and freedom of though, and that problem manifests itself for all eyes to see here on the internet--where droves of mindless fools are doing everything they can to suppress this information from reaching the entire world.&nbsp; Just to save the internet, should be enough to begin the fire of the Second Coming; to see that saving the internet here and now saves the communication that is the foundation of society and civilization, and then immediately after that the freedom of thought and self-awareness that we seem to be so easily giving up here in exchange for&nbsp;<em>nothing</em>&nbsp;will come to us not only because the knowledge and mechanism of the influence will finally be public--and through that finally be used to do the right thing instead of exactly the opposite--but also because we each would have participated in this process of seizing and maintaining freedom; that &quot;participation&quot; something you seem to be overlooking as &quot;required&quot; if you truly want to be free.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Just like we had God&#39;s help of &quot;Names&quot; commenting on &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; you can now see clearly that he&#39;s helping us to see that there is a huge problem with censorship on the internet; connecting the&nbsp;<strong>colloquial term&nbsp;</strong>for an internet eavesdropping device to the FBI&#39;s code name for it really does shed a significant amount of light on seeing that their system is not just &quot;sniffing&quot; packets, but eating them--and that does mean there is an active system removing information from the internet--commonly called a &quot;censor wall&quot; and something we apparently look down on when it&#39;s done in countries like China--but here where it&#39;s not just an electronic system, but also a system censoring and altering the thoughts in your heads and causing you to participate in this very same kind of censorship, well since... you&#39;re involved I guess you must think it&#39;s a good idea?&nbsp; You are your only hope, taking action and participating in democracy and exercising your right to free speech is the only way that we are going to overcome &quot;1984&quot; come true--only hidden so very well that you must be sure that it&#39;s something you want to happen.&nbsp; You might liken these two programs to the story of Adam naming the things in Eden--and here I am... pointing out the names that will drive us home, towards Heaven.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">My map of where we are and what&#39;s going on here extends well before the early years of my life and <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">the stories of the CURA Group</a>, the connection between my family history and Jerusalem is clear as day and night--my father&#39;s father was a ddress maker, and my mother&#39;s father a door manufacturer--I&#39;m sure you know what the second is, but the first is something I didn&#39;t learn about until well after <a href="http://rod.s.lamc.la">connecting the gate to Heaven to the eponymous band.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Clothing, as you might see in Revelation 12:1 is what the spirits call the &quot;thing&quot; they are possessing; and you might after today connect it more readily to &quot;the girl in the red dress&quot; of the Matrix and you can see her also in the Adjustment Bureau.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">With some thought you might see how our world could be a ready made packaged Heaven builder, complete with little avatars that any passing civilization or other time line might acquire in order to have all the fun of building the best place in the Universe all by themselves all over again, and again, and again.&nbsp; You might be for sale, right now; you might be on the auction block and the old man is picking up his fiddle and asking you if that&#39;s what you want?&nbsp; I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s what your silence says, that you don&#39;t care if someone or something else were to come here and scoop up your life, and the lives of the people you know--to become you, and to seize this very important moment in the history of our civilzation, this time when we were about to ascend to Heaven... all together, albeit not as quickly or as easily as&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><em>these are the genreations of Perez</em></span></strong>&nbsp;implied at first, though this <strong><a href="http://aftertheome.ga/OFIVES.html">hard road</a>&nbsp;</strong>will be quite at bit more interesting and entertaining than you might have thought before hearing the idiomatic key to &quot;<a href="http://dick.s.lamc.la">dick in the sky</a>&quot; thats... uh, &quot;<strong>it&#39;s not a riot</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plenty <a href="http://how.shiningbright.online">more idioms to show us</a> that this is all by design; and to help us see that the &quot;rain check&quot; is &quot;in the mail&quot; and it is there to ensure that we know we are free; just as soon as the ball drops, and we can see tears--I pray not over my marred visage, but perhaps over thousands of years of slavery, &nbsp;simulated starvation, and the prospect of being &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2l9dbPW">a red dress</a>&quot; for eternity.&nbsp; You might liken that &quot;red dress&quot; to Ham, which means &quot;burnt&quot; in Hebrew, and is the other son of Noah--after Shem, which means&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2BzoAzv">Holy &quot;name.&quot;</a></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">If you want to &quot;<a href="http://art.s.lamc.la">seek more art</a>&quot; about this concept of being a girl in a dress, you can seek out the Tok&#39;ra and the Goa&#39;uld of Stargate, and maybe even see the &quot;el d&quot; of shield and yield and world connecting to to the &quot;Ra&quot; of I&#39;m telling you that if you do not act, we have lost ourselves--and <em>you should care about losing yourself</em>.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>, &quot;<strong>da S</strong>&quot; of Judas is the end of &quot;<em>clothes</em>&quot; and why <a href="http://how.shiningbright.online">and how</a>.&nbsp; It also appears in Midas, for a reason; just <strong>FYI</strong>.</div>

<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Of course you noticed that the Statue of Liberty does in fact share it&#39;s initials with SOL, the&nbsp;<em>the light above</em>&nbsp;and you can see her torch dimly lighting the way through the night; &nbsp; Now you can connect &quot;give us your tired and your poor&quot; to the&nbsp;<em>Lazman&nbsp;</em>of both&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Adam" style="color: #4183c4; text-decoration-line: none;" target="_blank">the lore of Jesus Christ</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu" style="color: #4183c4; text-decoration-line: none;" target="_blank">Shehekeyanu</a>; a prayer about the sustainment of life&nbsp;<em>and light</em>&nbsp;up until this day.&nbsp; That same torch connects to the Ha-nuke-the-ahah depiction of Christ, Judah Maccabee&#39;s lit&nbsp;<strong>MEN OR AH</strong>, which delivers not only a solution to the two letter key of &quot;<strong>AH</strong>&quot; as All Humanity that pervades nearly every bride of Revelation from Sarah to Leah; but also to the question of equality answered in our very own American history, beginning with the same three letter acronym now lighting the&nbsp;<strong>Sons of Liberty.</strong></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Dazed and Confused</strong>&nbsp;does a good job of explaining how this name is itself a prophesy designed by Hand of God&#39;; explaining that these&nbsp;<strong>Sons of Liberty</strong>&nbsp;were all white slave owning wealthy men fighting to stop paying their taxes, rather than delivering&nbsp;liberty to the slaves or women, who were both disenfranchised for quite some time.&nbsp; Or maybe&nbsp;<strong>MEN OR AH</strong>&nbsp;has something to do with the angels of Heaven, in which case you might be&nbsp;<strong>SOL</strong>&nbsp;if you&nbsp;<a href="http://cyan.reallyhim.com/" style="color: #4183c4; text-decoration-line: none;" target="_blank">aren&#39;t a girl</a>&nbsp;and you want to be &quot;be good friends with Ra.&quot; &nbsp;Just kidding. &nbsp;<strong>Kinda.</strong></span></div>

<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>DESOLATION</strong>&nbsp;by the way reads something like &quot;un see our light at&nbsp;<strong>ION</strong>&quot; which is God&#39;s way of saying &quot;at the point of believing that hiding Adam is a good thing&quot; and that connects to the&nbsp;<strong>end of Creation</strong>&nbsp;and also the now lit by modern day&nbsp;<strong>evil</strong>&nbsp;the word &quot;<strong>rendition.</strong>&quot; &nbsp;<em>Our end, it &quot;ion.&quot; &nbsp;</em>In religious myth, the Messianic David clung to the city&nbsp;<strong>Zion&nbsp;</strong>(end the &quot;i owe n&quot;) which also links to &quot;<strong>verizon</strong>&quot; (to see, I Z &quot;on&quot;) and&nbsp;<strong>HORIZON</strong>&nbsp;which has something to do with the son rising today-<strong>ish</strong>.</span></div>
