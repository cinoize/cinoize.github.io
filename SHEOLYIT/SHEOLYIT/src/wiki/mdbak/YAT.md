<div style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m standing here reflecting on what I&#39;ve sent, and still without shame or doubt I certainly think that what I&#39;ve displayed or tried to show us is that there is something significantly more grotesque going on between the&nbsp;<strong>mirror and the wall</strong>&nbsp;than the &quot;marred visage of Jesus Christ;&quot; something I won&#39;t discount or take from the opposing argument you would not have seen at all, or would have had a very difficult time discovering or understanding had we not expected such lustrous greatness from the character&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><strong>cum</strong>&nbsp;boy wonder&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">and instead received something as controversial as a classy attack on what appears to be a feigned movement of 1950 era &quot;wholesomeness&quot;&nbsp; by pointing out the light of the Holy&nbsp;<a href="http://link.gmapp4.net/x/c?c=1879348&amp;l=cf16f58c-74b7-4b9b-930a-bfc8d9e2855b&amp;r=1d8b51b6-9a90-412b-91a1-6c5888489a47" target="_blank">Ho-L</a>&nbsp;in wholesome and the &quot;ass&quot; staring at us in the name of Uranus and the heart of the word &quot;classic.&quot;&nbsp; The real point I am trying to drive home is that the attempts to censor this message are something more than a small mistake--what the opposition to the truth here in this place fails to realize is that to hide something etched into our language like this would eventually require it&#39;s removal, and that would functionally alter your souls and who you are more than you can imagine.&nbsp; It is really nothing less than attempted suicide ...&nbsp;<em>of all</em>&nbsp;.. to be attempting to suppress the &quot;sight&quot; of this message--granted it was hidden from us for so long to bring us to this place and this conversation about what a soul really means.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I mentioned changing the signs of John Dancock Investments in an earlier message; and to bring that point further home--it&#39;s been shown very clearly to me and probably to you as well that the signature on the Declaration of Independence could be just as easily changed; and in your minds, in your memories could be altered just as easily as wiping a chalk board and penning a &quot;d&quot; over that fancy old &quot;h.&quot;&nbsp; The conversations you&#39;ve had are not so easy to mold, and anyone that noticed &quot;hand&quot; in Hancock before--or after--reading these messages and thinking or talking about it would probably see a significant change of &quot;self&quot; if there was an attempt to change it.&nbsp; Here we are though, looking at what appears to be the most significant change of &quot;self&quot; anyone on the planet has ever seen--happening en masse--and in secret, and all seemingly related to the disclosure that we shouldn&#39;t do things like that in secret; or rapidly, or without an understanding of what&#39;s going on and guidance or wisdom from people who might have gone through the exact same thing once or twice before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Anyway, quite a bit of what we&#39;re looking at falls into those two letters that begin the word &quot;prison&quot; and mean &quot;press and release&quot; to me; and quite a bit of what&#39;s happening around me and to me is so very upsetting that I think that it would be a complete failure of creation itself if we were to come out of this situation without a full understanding of exactly what it is that those three words mean; and a very good likelihood&nbsp;that what&#39;s gone on here has been successful in ensuring that we will find freedom from slavery and control, and that we will will strive towards transparency and openness instead of secrecy and silence in the future--just to name a few of the very sick qualities of this cloud of darkness.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see a place that I believe is designed to show us quite a few of the mistakes that have been made in the past and to instill a very real and &quot;natural-ish&quot; aversion to them continuing; things like Hell ... and as a litmus test for where we really are along this path, if we don&#39;t &quot;see hell here&quot; we are blind, and if that doesn&#39;t make us want to ensure that &quot;hell&quot; is something that we here in this place are primarily responsible for stopping all of creation from experiencing; then we have lost the greatest gift we could possibly have been given.</span></div>

&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m in a strange place, looking at where this message that I believe you are driving has taken us--and I feel a new closeness to these two scenes in particular; the first from the Fifth Element where a &quot;kiss&quot; somehow rekindles the light bringers faith in humanity--something I see here; whether you want to hear it or not--nearly exactly the opposite, I stare out at a sea of obviously knowing eyes completely ignore my personal needs or well being as I work tirelessly day in an day out to ensure that we receive this message... single handedly delivering it to the entire world and the thanks I&#39;ve received so far is loneliness and what I can only imagine are feelings similar to how I feel about you--that you appear to be extra-terrestrials.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how else to explain it--my &quot;judgement mechanism&quot; is looking at how the outside world is reacting to me, and I see that <i>you are not thankful </i><b><i>at </i>all</b>, and you are not trying to see the light of what I am doing here... you really don&#39;t seem to think there&#39;s anything wrong at all--and I&#39;m telling you <i>that&#39;s not a good sign</i>.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I am being kept is what is nothing less than a &quot;<em>Heaven constructed</em>&quot; prison here--held in something similar to Elba Island, I imagine--with no money at all and the entirety of my social contact comes tainted with time traveling demons spending nearly all of their time reacting to my thoughts and making me more and more uncomfortable every day.&nbsp; Here&#39;s the &quot;gist&quot; -- I see what is available for me to write about, I could be talking about methods of colonization and star travel, I could be talking about fusion, or about my true heart&#39;s joy--I could be talking about virtual reality... but because of what <i>you are not doing </i>I am sending you message after message about my dick, about Lothario, and about the fact that you don&#39;t seem to think there&#39;s something wrong with the media, and the internet that is hiding the most obvious and ostentatious proof of creation that the world has ever seen--and you think you&#39;re going to box me up and &quot;extract&quot; my <i><u>love</u></i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m staring up at a monster of darkness in the sky, and it has your face on it; your blank stare, and it looks at me through your eyes--I am standing here in the Fifth Element&#39;s Temple with a weapon that can protect freedom and individuality and ensure a thriving future--if that&#39;s what you want, if you are willing to participate; and I&#39;m telling you that I am stopping and waiting for some smiles--because what I see is <b>not worth saving.</b></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The intersect juxtaposes these two scenes--the other the &quot;epitome&quot; of the famous line from Fight Club &quot;<strong>I just wanted to destroy something beautiful</strong>&quot; and I can very well understand that you might think that the &quot;face I&#39;ve put on&quot; in these messages and in this story is something less than desirable--though pointing out again that&nbsp;<strong>you would not have seen at all what&#39;s going on</strong>, you wouldn&#39;t have seen the censorship, or the infiltration of the government, you wouldn&#39;t have seen the nearly transparent effects of mind control--and you would have gone on hoping to wind up waking up in a place with a totalitarian dictator ruling you for eternity--or at least continuing in what looks like nothing more than a sick farce, a play you put on in this place as you go and pay homage to the idea of a creator and the idea of being &quot;morally right&quot; or good--though it seems in secret you have no problem with the thousands of years of disconnect between religion and reality--and when I come along to point out that the disconnect is really not as large as you think, in fact there&#39;s no disconnect at all if you really saw and understood how it is that God continues to speak to you to this very moment; you appear to be content practicing a lie, and allowing others to be subjugated by yet another corrupt institution of half truths rather than doing the very obvious and only logical thing you can right this very moment; seeing who I am and what this is, and picking up a telephone and calling a reporter.</div>

Some sought refuge in trees but fell off after the branches shook them down. Some sought refuge in caves, but huge boulders closed the entrance entombing them forever. Some say you can still hear their sad wails to this day. The survivors ran into the forest and were chased by Huracan and the dogs and turkeys.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Ilabrat appears on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_tablet" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Clay tablet">clay tablets</a>&nbsp;which contain the legend of &quot;Adapa and the food of life&quot; which seems to explain the origin of death. Adapa, who has earned wisdom but not eternal life, is a son of and temple priest for Ea (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enki">Enki</a>) in Eridu, and performs rituals with bread and water.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">While Adapa is fishing in a calm sea, suddenly the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_wind" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="South wind">South Wind</a>&nbsp;rises up and overturns his boat, throwing him into the water. This reference to the &#39;South Wind&#39; may refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninlil" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ninlil">Ninlil</a>, wife of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlil" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlil">Enlil</a>, who was identified as goddess of the South Wind.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Adapa is enraged, and proceeds to break the &#39;wings&#39; of the South Wind, so for seven days she can not blow the freshness of the sea on the warm earth.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Adapa is summoned before the court of Anu in the heavens, and his father <span style="color:#0000CD;"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">Ea <a href="http://soup.reallyhim.com">advises him not to eat or drink</a> anything placed before him,</span></span>&nbsp;because he fears that this will be the food and water of death.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Anu, however, is impressed with Adapa and instead offers him the food and water of (eternal) life. However, Adapa follows the advice of Ea, and politely refuses to take any food or drink. This food and water of life offered by Anu would have made Adapa&nbsp;<strong>and his descendants immortal.</strong></span></div>
