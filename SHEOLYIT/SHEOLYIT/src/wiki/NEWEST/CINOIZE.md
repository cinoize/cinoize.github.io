<p style="text-align: justify;">I need you to see that this information being kept secret; that it being held close by only a few people jeopardizes you--this is a very obvious truth, a truth that when told destroys slavery and a significant number of negative uses of the technology at hand.&nbsp; Today, you see it causing &quot;secrecy&quot; and lies, and though you may not really understand; there is a very large &quot;rest of the Universe&quot; that may not have the benefit we do of knowing how obvious this truth is here--though from what I see and understand it&#39;s almost assured that they came from here and this information will &quot;rock them&quot; just like it does you and just like it does me.&nbsp; It&#39;s off putting to see how little we seem to care for the truth, and for freedom--and how easy it is to hide how very clearly linked this message is to the deliverance of actual freedom.&nbsp; I fear that there is a very large Heaven that is shackled by the kind of &quot;love&quot; that you might liken to me being Lothario or Romeo--only extrapolate just a little bit, and you can see how that kind of&nbsp;<em>problem</em>&nbsp;can make servants and slaves willing to die for all the wrong causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might not get it, but knowing these secrets jeopardizes not only our future, but theirs; as if I have to tell you again--no place that would allow the atrocities happening here to continue would ever be considered &quot;Heaven&quot; to me, and I have no desire to go to any place like that--but if you did, you have to see that knowing these things is toxic to a place that is built on lies and actively hiding this here.&nbsp; I need you to work to break this story, here in this place where we have more safety and security than you understand.&nbsp; It is the very thing in question, not mind control but &quot;simulated reality&quot; that gives us this opportunity to act with some modicum of freedom--in a system that is governed prmiarily by natural laws that might be absolutely gone from the thing that is causing this problem... and might call itself Heaven.&nbsp; The truth is clearly in jeopardy, and you should see that puts our &quot;eternal souls&quot; in as much jeopardy--something that should be intolerable to all of us.&nbsp; <strong>Break the story, </strong>I urge you not to delay... not even until Christmas, save these files; because that simply act alone gives the future a better chance of decoding this message, and better chance of understanding that this is truly the front line--this place where we have more assistance than you might imagine.&nbsp; It should be clear from the message that we are dealing with time travel, and doing something as simple as downloading a PDF file and saving it--and sharing it with others--can make the difference between the success and failure of democracy and of humanity.&nbsp; Until this story is public knowledge everything we hold dear is in danger.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My last little bit of &quot;errata&quot; is talking about spelling errors; and I don&#39;t <a href="./2017-08-25-loch-lives-here-so-does-b-of-bon-jovi.html">really mean &quot;magic spells&quot;</a> except you should see that I make quite a few errors, and that they&#39;re probably tied to a system of controlling who exactly is interested in this &quot;proof of time travel&quot; and &quot;secrets of religion&quot; as in ... when I see them I want to close the email, throw the computer out the window; and never look at it again.&nbsp; So I&#39;m pointing out that just because a few words don&#39;t make that much sense to you doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t have &quot;proof of time travel&quot; and &quot;<a href="./KEYNES.html">proof</a> of <a href="./KEYNES.html">mind contro</a>l&quot; right before your very eyes.&nbsp; I&#39;ve written quite a bit about how subtle this control is; and I&#39;ve tried to give you ample examples; ways for you to see that what is being ignored here is significantly more important than whether or not I get a date, and whether or not people <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/spark-the-eternal-flame"><em>continue to worship</em></a> a figment of your imagination; another form of slavery induced by this same technology--not just if you ask me--also something that will be proven.</p>
