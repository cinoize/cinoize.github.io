<div>I&#39;m done being driven into oblivion by your Silence; it&#39;s very clear to me what the purpose of this light and this message really is--it&#39;s designed to show me something, and to show you something, and I&#39;m telling you I see it very clearly now.&nbsp; I&#39;ve just got a Kindle, and I&#39;ve started reading some other people&#39;s ideas and beliefs; I&#39;m reading &quot;Transcendence&quot; by R.U. Sirius and it&#39;s pretty interesting.&nbsp; What this light has shown me is that you are consciously and willingly unified in this Silence... this sick and disgusting thing that today appears very clearly to be designed to perpetuate Hell.&nbsp; Whether or not it&#39;s your intention, your actions--not calling a newspaper or posting these messages on Facebook (by the way, there&#39;s a &quot;sharing&quot; toolbar on the side of my free book--all you have to do is click a button... anyway, whether or not it&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do ... the Silence is keeping the world enslaved in this twisted and coiled mass of people who are ignoring a message they know comes from the Matrix and from the hand of Jesus Christ telling them the point of all the music is to let freedom ring, and the point of all the dysptopian fiction is to help ensure that we don&#39;t have a dystopian future--but that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to build anyway.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align:justify"><span>This is strange, our generation ... this time is very strange, I think.&nbsp; Specifically what I&#39;m doing and seeing seems to be making things very strange, if not only for me.&nbsp; I can&#39;t really tell if you need to read the words I write to know what I&#39;ve written, like I can&#39;t tell if you need to hear to understand or speak to talk.&nbsp; The statistics I see are sort of incongruous, certain people will have a hundred opens on a particular email, and not a single link clicked--not one.&nbsp; I tracked down the fine grained details behind those stats, not just to satisfy my father's questioning of their accuracy; and lo, actual conversations appeared behind those high numbers... multiple user agents and IP addresses, and none of them clicked a link either.  Other times I&#39;ll see people open emails in flurries--it seems to me to get my attention or maybe your attention or God&#39;s attention; generally those people will have never opened an email before--or at least the few they&#39;ve opened right before I did my little &quot;show me the last 30 people that opened my email&quot; thing that I do.&nbsp; The other possible and implausible explanation--the thing that could be causing it--what I&#39;m seeing would happen if you took your entire SPAM box and marked it as &quot;not SPAM&quot; or maybe moved it into an archive.&nbsp; It happens quite often, it&#39;s a curiosity, I don&#39;t think people are archiving their SPAM.&nbsp; Then it sometimes happens with multiple people at a single domain, like a news station or a college--it&#39;s definitely some kind of communication, in my mind--but I don&#39;t see much more than &quot;hey, I&#39;m an angel, I&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family:garamond,serif">thought</span></i>.&quot;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">From the guy who sees patterns, its a pattern I see quite a lot; and I can tell you for sure those people are equally as unlikely to respond to my direct emails as those of you who open a message 30 times in 15 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">That doesn&#39;t really explain the level of strangeness that I&#39;m experiencing, not in the last bit.&nbsp; I&#39;ve known for some time--and told you now at least a few times, that I&#39;m not only talking to you, but I&#39;m also talking to something behind your eyes, to the sky above and the krypt below, to the thing that I see as the orchestrator of Medusa and even in a kind of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; way to Medusa prime, herself.&nbsp; Just to let her know I care.&nbsp; I know these things, I know them for sure--it&#39;s proven beyond doubt or question in my mind--I know them because answers come back to me to questions that I pose to this group, even to much smaller groups of people... answers come back through your mouths and your actions, the people I see around me .... whether it be in Boca Raton or in Beverly Hills.&nbsp; I see it in the eyes of drivers passing me by, sometimes turning their heads more often than not, I hear it in horns honking, and I see it in shaking heads and even ... every once in awhile, a pretty girl touching the frame of her glasses.&nbsp; Lately I&#39;ve seen it in some &quot;random&quot; Instagram follows from super models (I mean, they should be super models)--hey, more of that, please!</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify"><span>The point of that, of all of that is for me to tell you that I see Medusa is trying to give me the impression that the whole world is listening to what I&#39;m writing.&nbsp; Perhaps that they&#39;re behind my eyes as I write it, or maybe there&#39;s some ... perhaps competing groups of subconscious or conscious collectives (<span style='font-family:"comic sans ms",sans-serif'>or hives</span>) sort of sharing knowledge of what Adam&#39;s been up to as the chirps and nods flash and pop across the LAN--the thing I called once &quot;sustained epiphany in the LAN&quot; and now see as nothing more than &quot;the telephone game&quot; on virtual steriods, allowing lies to continue to spread, allowing the failure of the written word to seem &quot;inconsequential&quot; and nobody really seeing that&#39;s literally the undiong of the definitive prime characteristic of civilization.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really possible for everyone to understand this message and the change in the nature of our reality that it proves; I hope that&#39;s not the truth.&nbsp; Some people, only a handful now have outright confirmed that it&#39;s not the truth, a room mate in the house we know as &quot;Strickland&quot; on Mansfield phrased a clear rebuttal of that thought as &quot;it&#39;s not that, I can see why you think that, but it&#39;s not that&quot; when I told him that I thought maybe he knew everything I was writing.&nbsp; He and I know, he understands why I might think that because he probably really did hear my thoughts every once awhile in some strange kind of &quot;thought-show&quot; that I&#39;ll never really understand being kept secret, either.&nbsp; I think there are others, probably quite a few others that do hear every word I think; and even with significantly more fidelity than humanly possible, probably understanding or processing the source of each thought--the myriad of reasons and memories and learned behavior stored in how strongly a series of axons shake it&#39;s hand with a connected grouping of dendrites--they probably can even recall at will or with automatic instant replay the memories that lead to those connections and the memories that lead to those memories.... imagine that, super&nbsp;</span><i>angels</i><span>&nbsp;</span>that not only know everything but know why everything that is happening happens and still standing in silence as pain is simulated for no damned reason at all.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">and that goes to the heart of the problem--somewhere between yesterday and tomorrow something horrible happened here; things that were bad, or wrong... even evil were allowed to continue in plain sight (from simulated starvation to the overt destruction of &quot;fair trial&quot; and bail), even worse they were worsened intentionally, as if melting a man ten times over were akin to some kind of bad parenting technique to quit smoking; exacerbating already horrendous problems is no kind of solution--but it&#39;s the heart of where we are and the heart of the cross, and even worse than me saying it wasn&#39;t the source of the problem but it is the whole problem today... is what I see it doing to the world around me.&nbsp; I see it desensitizing us to things that on first glance would have been repulsive, and I see the morally weaker among us&nbsp; learning new sets of tricks... better ways to hide holocausts and smarter kinds of lies to tell to keep the people thinking they&#39;ve got control, or blame, or whatever other kind of carrot on a stick or unfinished homework shamefully hidden behind a cabinet might keep them &quot;getting one over&quot; on themselves and on everyone for just a few more minutes of the very last night they have.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify">To put this whole thing in perspective I can see we&#39;re an ice skating rink and god as the announcer is chastising&nbsp;me for being in places like the word &quot;hurry&quot; and maybe in his own way telling me that I should stop before climbing the stairs and stick my nose in another rose--on the other hand, though, you might see this slow and methodical (i c <a href="./2017-07-07-nightmare-on-elm-street.html">meth</a>&nbsp;and Odin, you?) transition as something of the tortoise winning the race, or a snail, or<span>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family:"comic sans ms",sans-serif'>molasses</span>... even, but the real truth--with any sight at all is that we are turbo boosting in the wrong direction, and still you are standing there with nothing to say at all, let alone parroting out &quot;there&#39;s a method to the madness.&quot;</div>

I said &quot;are you talking to me&quot; sort of quietly also, not really looking at her as I spoke the words.&nbsp; She responded by sticking her middle finger up, and definitely pointing it in my direction, sort of cupping it with her other hand and hiding it next to her breast--you wouldn&#39;t have seen it if you weren&#39;t me, or standing directly behind me.&nbsp; That was the end of the confrontation, I think I saw some ... it looked like one of the girls behind the counter said &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; with her eyes--words would probably help--you know, if people were &quot;speaking&quot; or communicating anything other than &quot;we don&#39;t get it&quot; we&#39;d be making lots of progress passed, <em>then you must be stupid.</em></div>
