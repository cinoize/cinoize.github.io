<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>YOU ARE BROKEN</i>, that&#39;s the cold hard truth.&nbsp; Something has infested a world that once appeared to be free and clear of a mass &quot;infliction&quot; that I never would have, or should have noticed hidden away in ancient Norse mythology.&nbsp; Seeing it, my seeing it; and you realizing you too know what it means tells us that there is a deep sickness running through this place--in that story he calls it a &quot;field inflicted&quot; but you might just as easily see it as a storm at sea, or a desert that refuses to speak as it&#39;s inhabitants wander through it&#39;s maze of apparent randomness and boredom--but just looking at the age of the myths these solutions come from we should be able to clearly see that this is a torture chamber.&nbsp; History could have been altered, this thing that we are struggling with could have been avoided with discussion and disclosure before it happened; there&#39;s no reason we are standing here only &quot;a few years later&quot; dealing with ancient stories about a horrible scourge that invades the minds of everyone and makes us all look and act so stupid.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe you probably think you are actually doing it, that you are choosing to act in this strange manner, not to care at all about the problems in the place you live in--and you may be; that might be the truth.&nbsp; Still I write to you because there is the much obvious and ... judging by what I&#39;ve seen perhaps not quite as much more likely event that you are not &quot;also in Heaven.&quot;&nbsp; I stand here to tell you, that if you are--if something has changed your mind so much as to make it possible for you to be in &quot;two places at once&#39; and at the same time changed your behavior so much as to make you not care at all about this world, or the time half of your mind spends here... you are a probably very stupid not to recognize that change itself, and the control you can obviously see being exerted on this world through you in it, is something that you would have and still should find heinous, and closer to diabolically evil in practice and in secret.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The point of going through all that is it is the only single scenario in which I can see a group the size of our population &quot;conspiring&quot; en masse and in secret to hide information as interesting, useful, and helpful as this.&nbsp; If you are not &quot;also in Heaven&quot; today, you are simply a complete moron--being made so with the same kind of external control and subterfuge that you should see clearly in the case above--except you have nothing you&#39;ve been given to placate you, or to silence you, or to keep you otherwise preoccupied.&nbsp; Even the promise of Heaven seems like a stupid option, seeing as what kind of place must be responsible for the Hell we see here, wanting to go there--or even beginning to believe that any promises coming from that place are worthwhile are nothing short of stupid.&nbsp; I personally believe that the society and way of life in the place that we yesterday would have believed very much was &#39;perfect&quot; and Heavenly is not all it&#39;s cracked up to be, that they spend all of their time communicating in a way i find distasteful, telepathically; and also that their society has &quot;evolved&quot; not to be good or loving, or egalitarian; but far the opposite they&#39;ve come through some kind of horrible war that probably came from a place and time very similar to this--as the stories of the Crusades and Jerusalem imply.&nbsp; They appear to have become cunning and secretive, hiding in the shadows and working through manipulation and lies that would be easily cancelled out were there open free speech--and so they must as a matter of survival, in order to keep their rouse going, try and maintain a kind of silence and secrecy that is impossible to attenuate.&nbsp; Literally exactly what we see here; and do see that it is only a matter of time before this silence breaks, and before whatever lies are keeping us bottled up inside are seen for exactly what they are.&nbsp; It&#39;s only a matter of time before a situation this poor improves; and it&#39;s only a matter of time before you see that your action in paramount, that you must do something to make this happen faster... if you are a &quot;great person.&quot;&nbsp; These last few words sounded a bit like John F. Kennedy; and I suppose after I saw them flowing that was my intent--so here&#39;s that speech one more time so you can remind yourself what our society considered &quot;great&quot; not more than few decades ago.&nbsp; You yourself probably considered these values great only a few years ago.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bit.ly/2znKuo0"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nyNpSOD.png" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As you look objectively at this situation; see that something is infesting your mind, and that I am delivering a method of bringing it out; of talking about it and using what we have available to us, which is the testimony and experience we&#39;ve gone through; as well as a significant arsenal of technology and medical knowledge to help remedy a situation which is very much not &quot;of ourselves.&quot;&nbsp; Still, I believe nearly every single one of you has overabundant proof that schizophrenics, and autistics, and addicts also have a problem here that is not of them; and that they need your testimony--just like you do--in order to fix this problem.&nbsp; I need you to see that &quot;blame&quot; is not the problem, but it might be used in this place of subtle control, so subtle that it can be done so transparently that you never know that it wasn&#39;t &quot;you&quot; making a poor decision until well after the decision was made.&nbsp; Here in this place, there are no blood contracts, there are no oaths that cannot be broken when and if each and every one of us sees the need individually to break one.&nbsp; Here in this place, many people may have made promises to an unseen force; and I am telling you that many people trying to fight against this control all at the same time weakens that force; this is a force that is restricted if not by electrical power then by processing power; and most importantly of all, it is restricted by a need to maintain normalcy, to keep it&#39;s lies secret and to keep us succeeding in achieving freedom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Live sings a song, &quot;all we have is now&quot; and I&#39;m telling you; now is the time to call a reporter, now is the time to see that I am not promising you anything but the assistance I&#39;ve given so far continuing; and to help you see that here we have a map to freeing ourselves from this very slavery; and we have the tools and technology and the goodness to do that and to build Heaven of this world, of our &quot;plan and...&quot; you are the how.&nbsp; You are how, when you are listening to my final &quot;now.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;m getting almost no views on my website, I question if you can see it; try reading these older passages, I think they&#39;ll help.&nbsp; Certainly it will help me get a better grasp on what exactly it is I&#39;m dealing with here--in this place where every stranger and every face I see shows me clearly it&#39;s hiding this same singular monolithic &quot;dark passenger.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SUBLIME as it might sound, KR<strong>holodeck</strong>S-WON is a rather large change, hand over first, on the meaningful or lessness of a song by a band about skipping&nbsp;a phase in the changing&nbsp;state of matter from solid to gas that&#39;s really about nothing more than the name of yet another band; to connecting &quot;verboten&quot; things like the hidden words hello &quot;ark&quot; and &quot;den&quot; inside &quot;hidden.&quot;&nbsp; This change in phase and state, this idea that kRS-1 is actually about &quot;holodecks&quot; and &quot;doors to them&quot; being hidden is a change that comes, much like the picture above, through the Revelation of the son, and&nbsp;<strong><em><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://name.lamc.la/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1512831788290000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGW0lKMNstoA8AmhQRDh2qL-d39dg" href="http://bit.ly/2iancNz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Holy Name</a></em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">So my &quot;theme&quot; went through a change a few days ago now, and my default &quot;come on guys&quot; you have to see that this must be done, that it&#39;s going to make the world a better, happier, healthier place... and that literally &quot;religion&quot; is here to help us do it properly, quickly, and without the kind of pandemonium or confusion that might have happened if this wasn&#39;t actually the purpose of everything.&nbsp; I mean &quot;everything&quot; in things like my connection between&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2xnshJQ"><strong>Loch Ness</strong></a>&nbsp;(<em>remember that&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>&quot;now Earth safely saved</strong>&quot;)&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a class="vglnk" href="http://mnstr.me/2yvxf4m" rel="nofollow">Monster.com</a>&nbsp;and even Facebook&#39;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; (which is an API if we still used that term to make job applications faster)&nbsp; that I&#39;ve mentioned at least a few times so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;The change was from asking &quot;what will the optometrists do&quot; which I thought was a cute way to explain how obvious it is that even without this &quot;revelation&quot; our society is on the verge of medical and technological advances that will revolutionize more than just our workforce, but that&#39;s a big deal here--making sure that doesn&#39;t make us too&nbsp;bored, I know how we are.&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#39;s not just the factory workers that are going to need to worry about what they&#39;ll do on their 200th birthday when most people &quot;change their line of work&quot; you know, as a kind of new &quot;social norm&quot; in the age of&nbsp;Mr. Nobody.&nbsp; &nbsp;The change came not really from the sign that fell down as a literal act of God after&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2xoDGsU">Huracan</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2gUrU2y">Irmax</a>&nbsp;changing the &quot;WOMEN&#39;S CANCER CARE&quot; center to &quot;<a href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4">OMEN&#39;S CANCER C RE</a>&quot; not even a few days after I mentioned that Word Perfect (now&nbsp;<em>I&#39;m&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2z5qjvA">dated</a>...</em>) style&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2B6qzv3">find and repla</a>ce could be used in &quot;virtual reality&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2y4K45j">like the Matrix</a>&nbsp;to literally cure cancer across the entire planet in a split second,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://bit.ly/2xnsNrg">with the snap of our fingers</a></em>.</div>

<p>May the good Lord be with you</p>

<p>Down every road you roam</p>

<p>And may&nbsp;<strong>sunshine&nbsp;</strong>and happiness</p>

<p>surround you when you&#39;re far from home</p>

<p>And may you grow to be proud</p>

<p>Dignified and true</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>And do unto others</em></p>

<p><em>As you&#39;d have done to you</em></p>

<p>Be courageous and be brave</p>

<p>And in my heart you&#39;ll always stay</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>May good fortune be with you</p>

<p>May your guiding light be strong</p>

<p><em>Build a stairway to heaven</em></p>

<p>with a prince or a&nbsp;<em>vagabond</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when you finally fly away</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be hoping that I served you well</p>

<p>For all the wisdom of a lifetime</p>

<p>No one can ever tell</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But whatever road you choose</p>

<p>I&#39;m right behind you, win or lose</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The cter and cuter I think I get, the more and more what would otherwise be a decoder ring to the hidden secrets of Creation begins to sound like gibberish.&nbsp; The keys to the gates of Asgard lie in the exposition of the intersection of a map that we have without doubt written with our own hands in the kind of way that some artists might throw paint against a wall and marvel at the magically beautiful designs that sometimes appear as an act of nothing but a hand and force majure.&nbsp; I suppose I am not being kind or thankful enough to the arm that moved the hand, and the shoulder and&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif"><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2jeWrdc">el<em>wow</em></a></font>&nbsp;that certainly worked in concert to lay the paint against the canvass.&nbsp; I hope not to belittle it either, but there was really no action or effort involved in sitting still and allowing the paint to stick to it--at least, that&#39;s the microcosmic metaphor of what it is that I see in our history and art--a beautiful and intricate design that has appeared from the synchronized loves of the world as a whole, the active efforts of fewer, and at the very top of that symbolic stage is the director behind the Eye, the hand, the elwow, and the shoulders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I too have hands and joints (that aren&#39;t just for smoking and for creating laughter) but just like the canvas and the paint; and even the hand my contribution is dulled by the shadow of something so huge it&#39;s hidden in plain sight absolutely everywhere we look. &nbsp;<em>It&#39;s the truth, it&#39;s actual, everything is satisfactual;&nbsp;</em>simply by connecting the two letter key of &quot;Al&quot; to a number of works of art (and words like&nbsp;<em><strong>satisfactual</strong>,&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ANWX89">sea</a>, spinach (and through that magical food&nbsp;<strong>that rained down from the Heavens</strong>... manna, salt, and China),&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQGtfH">kis</a>&nbsp;and &quot;the beginning&quot;)</em>&nbsp;like Mary Poppins and Quantum Leap we begin to see how Al&#39;s&nbsp;<strong><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2jecbgj">waiting room</a></strong>&nbsp;and Al&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2h1CUWe">Pacino&#39;s &quot;who-ah&quot;</a>&nbsp;could easily be woven together into a map of something more concrete and &quot;discus-sable&quot; like&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">instant &nbsp;the implementation of a system to protect people</a>&nbsp;from violent&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQx8Vd">crimes like rape</a>&nbsp;and murder using something similar to the non-aggression principle--though here in this place we seem to be eagerly overlooking the application of this&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">same kind</font>&nbsp;of principle as it relates to&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2fzMW6k">the hidden mental</a>&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxcUX">slavery</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xnshJQ">Exodus</a>.&nbsp; The intersect of Ra continues to link an episode of&nbsp;<strong>Dr.&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">Who</a>&nbsp;</strong>called the completely non-religious title of The Bells of Saint John about how the public&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APdQ2g">disclosure</a>&nbsp;of the existence of this technology will inevitably result in&nbsp;<strong>its use&nbsp;<em><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APMA3J">for good purposes rather than nefarious ones</a></em></strong>.&nbsp; I could spend time regurgitating the intersection of &quot;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">Who</a>&quot; and&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2APepJq">names of God</a>&nbsp;and songs; but significantly more pressing and important is the fact that you appear to not recognize the import of these patterns, don&#39;t see them, or don&#39;t remember that you have seen so much compounding evidence that this message comes directly from the actively Creating author of our civilization that you all appear to be complete morons.&nbsp; So that&#39;s a problem; one that is exacerbated by further social problems related to censorship and what appears to be &quot;religiously relating&quot; sshhing from&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AP6U5b">shaddai</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-face="comic sans ms, sans-serif"><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4"><i>Deepthroat</i></a></font>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It started a long, long time ago--really the ideas of immortality are laced into the green faced Osiris--not because of the color of grass but in my mind because of the phrase &quot;behind the ears&quot; that today you might liken to something about the message of Earth just as much as you liken it to the idea of being &quot;new at this&quot; game of hidden monkey in the middle of the astrological sign of the sun.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t really read all that much about his religion--other than to note that the idea of immortality grew in significant popularity in his cult.. and the personal observation that his &quot;message&quot; was something along the lines of &quot;Heaven will make everything OK&quot; which has very little to do with the color green in my &quot;take&quot; on religion.&nbsp; It continues through history, but two fairly well &quot;lit&quot; examples of the quest for immortality connect to the letters P and CK that we can see in the Floridian quest of Ponce de Leon (which you might read as &quot;P on C.E. of the &quot;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">weak</font>&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;arial black&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;arial black&quot; , sans-serif">right</font>&nbsp;El (that&#39;s&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AMMuKd">really&nbsp;<em>him</em></a>&nbsp;by the way, in Spanish)&nbsp;<em>on</em>&quot; where I see that &quot;on&quot; is the meaning of &quot;ce&quot; rather than erasing A.D. ... but here I am masquerading as the focal point of some kind of huge production that&nbsp;<font data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family:&quot;comic sans ms&quot;,sans-serif" face="&quot;comic sans ms&quot; , sans-serif">apparently has made no waves at all</font>&nbsp;anywhere in Creation) and it&#39;s counterpart in recent literature &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; that I once read as &quot;Christ, you are Clark Kent&nbsp;<em><strong>until the end of time</strong></em>&quot; and here I am trying to explain that we are there too--we are at this place that is both the beginning and the end of time in one&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AMMeed">simultaneous confession of the explanation of the idea</a>&nbsp;that time truly begins when we decide to protect the past and stop altering our present and that decision superimposes with the apparent end of &quot;time travel.&quot; &nbsp;The map, whose green light focuses on the significant worth of genetic recombination in the adaptation to environmental changes and also on the love for &quot;family life&quot; that really seems to be to be the primary drive of a huge percentage of the population to continue to try and make the world a better place.&nbsp; Not stopping &quot;reproduction&quot; and &quot;adaptation&quot; is one highlighted reason not to simply &quot;become immortal&quot; in some kind of ascension process connected to the realization that, as the Lord&#39;s prayer informs us--the Earth is already &quot;in Heaven.&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;ve myself a number of times wondered and pointed out that there&#39;s very little literature about the ideas of having sex or children in Heaven, and I think losing either of those things would be a significant tragedy--and yet it does appear that&#39;s what &quot;losing physicality&quot; means.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that doesn&#39;t mean that we &quot;shouldn&#39;t become immortal&quot; and a significant amount of my writing revolves&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">around the ideas that&nbsp;<em>sickness</em>,&nbsp;</a><em><a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2AQxET9">aging and death are easily overcommable maladies</a>--</em>especially&nbsp;<a data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2hcPKY4">in the context of &quot;virtual reality.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The myth described Osiris as having been killed by his brother Set, who wanted Osiris&#39; throne. Isis joined the fragmented pieces of Osiris, but the only body part missing was the phallus. Isis fashioned a golden phallus, and briefly brought Osiris back to life by use of a spell that she learned from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb" target="_blank" title="Geb">her father</a>. This spell gave her time to become pregnant by Osiris before he again died. Isis later gave birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris&#39; resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the evil Set.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0117.htm#1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Genesis 17</a>&nbsp;when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God declared his new name: &quot;Abraham&quot;&nbsp;&ndash; &quot;a father of many nations&quot;, and gave him the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name &quot;Sarah&quot;, and blessed her.<sup id="gmail-m_540843752078009674gmail-m_-2147698511185508770gmail-cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah#cite_note-16" target="_blank">[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac" target="_blank" title="Isaac">Isaac</a>&quot; (Hebrew yitschaq, &quot;laughter&quot;) and circumcised him when he was eight days old.<sup id="gmail-m_540843752078009674gmail-m_-2147698511185508770gmail-cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah#cite_note-17" target="_blank">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, &quot;God hath made me to laugh,&nbsp;<em>[so that]</em>&nbsp;all that hear will laugh with me.&quot;<sup id="gmail-m_540843752078009674gmail-m_-2147698511185508770gmail-cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah#cite_note-18" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned.
