<p style="text-align: justify;">Not to disparage Microsoft, 23 and Me, or <em>everyone else on the planet</em> for not noticing it&ndash;but to quote this story &quot;it&rsquo;s quite a bit of work to encode 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s to the four DNA building blocks, GOD-<em>SEE</em>-AT (hey AT, C AL), and it;&#39;s just like this story of never ending darkness to watch us fail to make simple connections, despite them being pointed out &hellip; at least four different&nbsp;<a href="https://kutt.it/HI9UiL">times over the course of the last four years</a>, already.

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>not a cognitive leap</em>, but it does for the most part make Microsoft&rsquo;s work &ldquo;a complete waste of time&rdquo; &hellip; rather than mimicking biological storage we&rsquo;d be much better off working on creating a similar form of 1 to 1 &ldquo;mirror image backbone&rdquo; which is why DNA requires four bits to encode everything bit of your body along with instruction on how to build it in &ldquo;binary A&rsquo;s and G&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Using the amino acids that RNA trans codes to also delivers the added benefit of having plenty of &ldquo;biological in cell machinery&rdquo; to study and copy the functionality of. It&rsquo;s a little baffling that Microsoft is moving sooooo slowly and is still, years later, only reporting encoding &ldquo;200 MB&rsquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; I imagine that&rsquo;s not a great sign for the future of &ldquo;science and technology&rdquo; &hellip; but it&rsquo;s a great &ldquo;press and release&rdquo; notification alarm to signal further just how retarded &ldquo;binary computing&rdquo; really is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Making a molecular storage system that encodes in binary bits is just about as stupid as thinking &quot;mother nature has a brain&quot; ... or that we aren&#39;t &quot;<em>of time and chance.</em>&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Synthetic DNA is durable and can encode digital data with high density, making it an attractive medium for data storage. However, recovering stored data on a large-scale currently requires all the DNA in a pool to be sequenced, even if only a subset of the information needs to be extracted. Here, we encode and store 35 distinct files (over 200 MB of data), in more than 13 million DNA oligonucleotides, and show that we can recover each file individually and with no errors, using a random access approach. We design and validate a large library of primers that enable individual recovery of all files stored within the DNA. We also develop an algorithm that greatly reduces the sequencing read coverage required for error-free decoding by maximizing information from all sequence reads. These advances demonstrate a viable, large-scale system for DNA data storage and retrieval.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the normal intonation and meaning behind that phrase is something of disbelief, &ldquo;oh my fucking God, <em>how is this happening</em>?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s mostly&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;I think, tainted with a sight tinge of &ldquo;we should all know better&rdquo; &hellip; and yet we say that name as if &hellip;</p>

What the &ldquo;Thoat Police&rdquo; are doing here is significantly worse than watching torture, they are actively participating in torturing me and thousands of others &hellip; this thing I keep writing about, &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/KEYNES.html">gang stalking</a>&rdquo; as if you didn&rsquo;t <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/SAYFREED.html">recognize already</a> that it <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ARFAXAD.html">is&nbsp;<em>the Tribulation</em>&nbsp;and</a> it is all about achieving freedom from a hidden technology being used to hide itself and to hide the truth about reality, and about Heaven&hellip; a place you should see is &ldquo;not so heavenly&rdquo; to be actively doing these things.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear from &ldquo;Nanna&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alec Baldwin&rdquo; this is a sure fire match and just one more thing you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to ignore as you trek through the wilderness of realizing we&rsquo;re not on a &ldquo;moving ark&rdquo; and the destination isn&rsquo;t some place we physically have to arrive at, but much closer to a &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html">spiritual journey</a>&rdquo; as God once told me it was before I had any idea the whole thing is really about you &hellip; turning around whatever it is that&rsquo;s causing this strange communication and this strange silence, and this idiotic inability to acknowledge a message that you clearly see. I imagine you must see some benefit to destroying democracy and the news (as you sit here pretending this alarm is unimportant because you&rsquo;re aligned with the invisible place doing the destroying), that you have been promised something very enticing to give up on &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/TY.html">walking to Heaven</a>&rdquo; and being bestowed with the great task and honor of ending Hell and pain and disease and doing so not just for you and yours and your world but beginning a process that will sweep through all of Creation&hellip; resulting in what I can only imagine will be some kind of thanks and adulation from the entirety of our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think you must &ldquo;ha&#39;v&nbsp;something&rdquo; already in exchange for what you are doing to yourselves here, and I think you must miss the point that &hellip; the lack of action here is something significantly worse it &ldquo;<em>appears on face</em>&rdquo; it&rsquo;s &hellip; well, it&rsquo;s closer to being bestowed with the great distinction of being &ldquo;the Great Satan&rdquo; and perpetuating or worse, creating Hell for the future. It&rsquo;s probably why &ldquo;the onion router&rdquo; is encoded in Torah, and why that might have something to do with the &ldquo;TO RY&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve recently linked to the &ldquo;missing victory&rdquo; of Milosevic &hellip; one of the names I picked out looking for &hellip; who would be &ldquo;left out&rdquo; if we only excluded people responsible for &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; you see, until you realize there&rsquo;s a conspiracy of all responsible for genecide here and now, responsible for killing children and starving millions &hellip; intentionally, through nothing more than &ldquo;pretending not to see.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="me-lose-vic" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><strong><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;">ME LOSE VIC</span></strong></span></h2>
<p>&hellip; and what&rsquo;s that got to do with the&nbsp;<em>civ</em>ili &hellip; Z?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what&rsquo;s missing (a thing, an addition to the word game&ndash;<em>in my head</em>, at least), the &ldquo;TO RY&rdquo; of victory, those two letters a special &ldquo;our and&hellip;&rdquo; that is the heart of the Shekinah, the transition from &ldquo;Eve&rdquo; to &ldquo;all humanity&rdquo; that makes up the Hebrew word for the Spirit of America (I mean of God) connected through &ldquo;kin.&rdquo; Anyway, for those of you that don&rsquo;t see it, the great book of Names &hellip; with it&rsquo;s hidden meaning and information disclosure in every single one of your names &hellip; it&rsquo;s something like an &ldquo;intelligent TOR&rdquo; a masking of what might have been &hellip; some other name in a place before Soviet was clearly hiding the &ldquo;name of God.&rdquo; Of course I see that our history is intelligently designed, and that in many cases it appears to be so in a way that stems from names&ndash;rather than the names being &ldquo;tags&rdquo; about what is happening. I think I see clearly that it&rsquo;s proof of Creation itself, rather than a &ldquo;heist of a generation&rdquo; or a timeline &hellip; though, you should see clearly the heist in play is &hellip; my name and any memory having anything to do with me. That&rsquo;s everything, by the way, all of our history and every company name here, and everything we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s everything.</p>
